General Electric 继承人选<br><br>
McNerney competed with Bob Nardelli and Jeff Immelt to succeed the retiring Jack Welch as chairman and CEO of General Electric. When Immelt won the three-way succession race, McNerney and Nardelli left GE (as was Welch's plan); McNerney was hired by 3M in 2001.<br><br>

Worst American CEOs Nardelli<br><br>
Robert Louis "Bob" Nardelli (born May 17, 1948, in Old Forge, Pennsylvania) is an American businessman. He was the chairman and chief executive officer of Chrysler. He had earlier served in a similar capacity at The Home Depot from December 2000 to January 2007. Prior to that, Nardelli had risen to become one of the top four executives at General Electric. CNBC named Nardelli as one of the "Worst American CEOs of All Time".<br><br>

America's worst CEOs: Where are they now?<br><br>

BySteve TobakMoneyWatchApril 27, 2012<br><br>

Last week, I was watching Nokia's (NOK) meltdown and remembering the CEO who more or less brought the once dominant cell phone maker to its knees,.<br><br>

When it was all but obvious that Nokia had completely missed the market transition to smartphones, when the board of directors was quietly interviewing new CEO candidates, Kallasvuo was still in complete denial about his critical missteps and staggering lack of vision and strategic planning.<br><br>

That got me thinking about a subject that never ceases to both amaze and appall me. How bad -- even horrendously bad CEOs that cost shareholders billions and thousands of employees their jobs -- don't just get fired and fade into oblivion. They get recycled, meaning they either get other CEO jobs, get to sit on all sorts of boards of directors, or run for public office.<br><br>


Here are seven of the worst CEOs I've written about over the years and what they're doing now. And don't ask about Enron's Jeff Skilling or WorldCom's Bernie Ebbers -- they're both doing fine in their fashionable orange jumpsuits in federal prison. That said, former Tyco (TYC) CEO Dennis Kozlowski is now participating in a work-release program in the 79th month of his prison term for robbing shareholders blind of millions in fraudulent bonuses and loans.<br><br>

Gerald Levin, former CEO of Time Warner (TWX). After famously merging Time Warner with AOL at the peak of the dot-com bubble -- widely believed to be one of the dumbest moves in the history of corporate America -- Jerry Levin dropped out of site and emerged as Chairman of Oasis TV, chairperson of StartUp Health, chairman of Organized Wisdom, and presiding director of Moonview Sanctuary, a "holistic healing institute." No kidding.<br><br>

Bob Nardelli, former CEO of Home Depot (HD) and Chrysler. Named one of the "Worst American CEOs of all time" by CNBC after sending Chrysler into bankruptcy, Nardelli served as interim CEO for gunmaker Freedom Group and director of NewPage Corp. He recently stepped down as CEO of the operations and advisory company at private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management, which owned all those companies. <br><br>

Jonathan Schwartz, former CEO of Sun Microsystems. After serving as president and COO at Sun since 2004, replacing Scott McNealy as CEO in 2008, failing to turn the Silicon Valley giant around, and presiding over who knows how many "death by a thousand cuts" restructurings and layoffs, Schwartz finally sold the company to Oracle (ORCL). He's now co-founder and CEO of caregiver software startup CareZone and serves on the boards of Taleo (TLEO), Silver Spring Networks, and Moxie Software.<br><br>

Mike Zafirovski, former CEO of Nortel. After failing to turn around the 110 year-old Canadian network giant, sending Nortel into bankruptcy, selling off the company in pieces, and suing the bankrupt company for $12 million, last year Zafirovski was hired as a senior advisor to private equity firm The Blackstone Group (BX) and appointed to the board of Apria Healthcare. He's also a director at Boeing (BA).<br><br>

Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, former CEO of Nokia. Kallasvuo was recently elected to the board of directors of Europe's fifth-largest telecom company, TeliaSonera (TLSNF). He's also vice chairman of SRV Group and is a board member of Aperios Group, European Design Leadership Board, and the Finnish Foundation for Economic Education. Nice.<br><br>

Gary Forsee, former CEO of Sprint. After a long career in telecom, Forsee became CEO of Sprint (S) in 2004 and wasted no time engineering a disastrous merger with Nextel. He was ousted by the board in 2007 and still managed to walk away with an exit package of over $40 million. And get this: Before his last day at Sprint Nextel (S), he was already hired as president of the University of Missouri System, a position he held until 2011. He's also served as a director of Ingersoll-Rand (IR), Great Plains Energy (GXP), Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT), and various civic and nonprofit organizations.<br><br>

Carly Fiorina, former CEO of HP (HPQ). Unless you've lived under a rock for the past 10 years, you know that Fiorina engineered HP's controversial merger with Compaq, was ousted by the board in 2005, and later lost a bid to replace incumbent Barbara Boxer as U.S. Senator for California. But you probably don't know that, earlier this week, she was named chairman of the board of nonprofit Good360. The cancer survivor also serves on a number of other nonprofit boards and councils and is a former director of Kellogg (K), Cisco (CSCO), Merck (MRK), and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).<br><br>

No doubt, someday I'll be writing about the exploits and board seats of former Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Jerry Yang, former SAP (SAP) and HP CEO Leo Apotheker, Kodak (EK) CEO Antonio Perez, and former Research In Motion (RIM) co-CEOs Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis. But that's another story for another day.  
<br><br>






Nardelli attended Rockford Auburn High School in Rockford, Illinois and received his Bachelor of Science in business from Western Illinois University in Macomb, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Nardelli also earned an MBA from the University of Louisville. He is married to Susan L. Schmulbach with four children and attend Roman Catholic church.<br><br>

General Electric<br><br>

Nardelli joined General Electric in 1971 as an entry-level manufacturing engineer. From 1988 to 1991, Nardelli was an executive for a division of the construction equipment maker, J. I. Case Company, which was then part of Tenneco.
<br><br>
By 1995, he had risen to president and CEO of GE Power Systems, also having the title of GE senior vice president. Nardelli was often known as "Little Jack", after his mentor Jack Welch, whom Nardelli had ambitions to succeed as CEO of GE. When Jack Welch retired as chairman and CEO of GE, a lengthy and well-publicized succession planning saga ensued. Nardelli competed with James McNerney and Jeffrey R. Immelt to succeed Welch. With Immelt winning the three-way race, Nardelli and McNerney left GE (as was Welch's plan). About 10 minutes after Welch let him go, Nardelli received a job offer from Kenneth Langone, who at the time was on the boards of both GE and The Home Depot.<br><br>
Home Depot<br><br>

Nardelli became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000, despite having no retail experience. Using the Six Sigma management strategy also used at GE, he dramatically overhauled the company and replaced its entrepreneurial culture. He changed the decentralized management structure, by eliminating and consolidating division executives. He also installed processes and streamlined operations, most notably implementing a computerized automated inventory system and centralizing supply orders at the Atlanta headquarters.<br><br>

Nardelli was credited with doubling the sales of the chain and improving its competitive position. Revenue increased from $45.74 billion in 2000 to $81.51 billion in 2005, while net earnings after tax rose from $2.58 billion to $5.84 billion. During Nardelli's tenure, Home Depot stock was essentially steady while competitor Lowe's stock doubled, which along with his $240 million compensation eventually earned the ire of investors.[3] His blunt, critical and autocratic management style turned off employees and the public. Nardelli was notably criticized for cutting back on knowledgeable full-time employees with experience in the trades and replacing them with part-time help with little relevant experience.[4] This move reduced costs, but hurt customer service at a time when Lowe's was making inroads nationwide. While the board strongly stood by him for most of his tenure, questions about his leadership mounted in 2006, and in an ominous portent of the near future, he was the only director present at the annual meeting; he only allowed shareholders to speak for a minute each.[5] When the board reportedly ousted him in January 2007,[6] Nardelli's severance package was estimated at $210 million. He was succeeded by The Home Depot vice chairman and executive vice president, Frank Blake. Blake had served as Nardelli's deputy at both GE Power Systems and Home Depot.<br><br>

During his tenure at Home Depot, Nardelli met President George W. Bush at the White House in 2002 and was appointed to Bush's Council on Service and Civic Participation (although he is no longer a member).[7] Nardelli also hosted a garden reception/fundraiser for Bush at his Atlanta home on May 20, 2004.<br><br>

Chrysler<br><br>

On August 5, 2007, he became chairman and CEO of Chrysler, which had recently been taken private by private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management. His annual salary at Chrysler was $1, with other compensation not publicly disclosed. (It's rumored that the terms were that he wouldn't be paid unless Chrysler succeeded. If they did succeed, he would be paid a salary along the lines of $30 million.)[9]<br><br>

On February 17, 2008, before his first Daytona 500 race as Chrysler CEO, Nardelli guaranteed that Dodge would win the race for the first time since 2002, and that he would award a $1 million bonus to the Dodge team that did it. Ryan Newman, the driver of the #12 Alltel Dodge, fulfilled this promise, and his car owner Roger Penske collected the $1 million bounty.[10]<br><br>

On December 4, 2008, in an appearance on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, when asked "So what do you say about the argument that the Japanese, the Germans, Koreans make better cars than the Americans?" Nardelli responded, "We spent about half a billion dollars in the first several months. Our warranty costs are down 29%. It's an interesting comparison because in the hearing today, going around the panel, the majority of the Senators said that citing specific vehicles that they own that they've got 60, 70, 80,000 miles. The comment was you guys are making them too good and therefore, we're not buying vehicles and we're contributing to your problem. That was from the Senators on the committee today."[11]<br><br>

On March 17, 2009, Nardelli said that Chrysler Financial would require a second round of loans.[12] On April 21, 2009, it was alleged by an unnamed "federal watchdog agency" that a $750 million loan from the government was turned down, on the grounds that it would have required that executive compensation be capped. According to contemporary media coverage "as part of the economic stimulus package, Congress approved compensation limits, and the Treasury is working on clarifying what the firms must do to comply with the rules. In other words, the executives were asked to sign the waivers without knowing what specific limits the Treasury might set." [13] On April 30, 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The same day, Bob Nardelli announced that he would leave the company as soon as the bankruptcy was over, and his replacement was announced (Sergio Marchionne [14]), who would likely face a pay cap.<br><br>
