	<b><a name="T2">MAKING PROGRESS</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

GE has stayed competitive for more than a century―not
because we are perfect―but because we make progress.
Progress is about getting better, being better, doing better;
this is why GE people get up every day. We are missionbased.
GE technology and people move, power, build
and cure the world. As investors, you can expect us
to listen, learn, adapt and change. You should expect
us to get better every day, to make progress.<br><br>


The diffi cult part about progress
is that great results take time. But,
the pay-back can be huge. Last
November, we received $40 billion
of engine wins at the Dubai Air
Show ― in two days. These commitments
were for revolutionary new
products that have come to market
in the past few years. They are based
on big bet technologies, years in
the making and delivered ahead of
the competition.<br><br>
Leading these results was the GE9X,
which is the sole-source engine for the
Boeing 777X. This plane is 20% more
fuel effi cient than the one it replaced,
saving airlines $11 million per airplane
per year. The GE engine drives
50% of this improvement based on
innovative new technology in compressors
and combustors. This new
engine ― the largest and most fuel
effi cient in the world ― has only 16 fan
blades, down from 22 in its predecessor.<br><br>
This achieves efficiency and
reliability for our customers. And,
to further performance, it is based
on a GE invention: a new material
called ceramic matrix composite.
This material retains its strength at
2200°F ― 500°F higher than metal ―
at one-third the weight.<br><br>
Our wins in Dubai came primarily
from three customers: Emirates,
Etihad and Qatar Airways. None of us
grew up at GE with them as customers.
Each has emerged as a global
leader in the past decade. And, we
have built an excellent relationship
with them based on solid operational
performance and mutual trust. The
combination of superior technology
and strong relationships is the
essence of competitiveness and
allowed GE to win virtually all of
the commitments at the show.<br><br>
Winning takes bold commitments,
a dedicated team and resilience.
There were at least two “moments of
truth” as we invested in our new
engine line-up. After the 9/11 tragedy,
the commercial aviation industry
was in full crisis. Instead of panicking,
we increased our investment in the
business and our customers. This
has created trust and loyalty for GE
that is unmatched. In 2008, during
the depth of the fi nancial crisis, we
substantially increased our investment
in commercial engine R&D.<br><br>
Because we made the right bets, we
have the best products at the right
time, securing decades of leadership
for your Company. The desire to
compete and win runs deep across
the Company.<br><br>
GE’s ability to innovate is particularly
crucial in the slow-growth and volatile
economy we live in today. Frequently
I tell investors that if we ever see a U.S.
economy like the ones we had in the
’90s, GE will have earnings upside.<br><br>
While we don’t expect that soon, there
are signs that the U.S. economy is
getting a little better each day.<br><br>
<a href= "pic03.html">THE GE WORKS EQUATION</a><br><br>

Meanwhile, Europe has stabilized;
while its expansion is anemic, the “daily
crises” have been eliminated. And,
there are pockets in the region that
are robust for GE like Germany, the
Nordic region and Central Europe.<br><br>
We still see opportunities in emerging
markets. China is one important
engine of growth. China has massive
fi nancial strength, and we see
its reform efforts as a positive. GE
has a major role in helping China
solve its healthcare, clean energy
and transportation challenges. In
the resource-rich countries, our
prospects are bright despite a more
volatile macro-situation. GE provides
the capability for these countries to
industrialize through our technology
and localization efforts. That is
why our growth is accelerating in
regions like the Middle East, Russia
and Africa despite social and political
unrest.<br><br>
The world is complicated. But, through
the fog of the last fi ve years, I would
take the 2014 economy any day. The
recovery is slow, but there are no
major headwinds. While governments
are not addressing major challenges
like immigration and regulatory
reform, there is less disruption. And,
we have the fi nancial strength to make
progress on our own.<br><br>
We are positive about the future. We
have positioned GE to capitalize on
the growth themes of the era. We are
investing to lead in the new technologies
that will drive effi ciency for the
Company and our customers. We are
improving our speed and lowering
our cost. We plan to deliver a valuable
fi nancial performance. We are making
progress.

	<b><a name="T3">Most Competitive Infrastructure Company</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We Are the World’s Most
Competitive Infrastructure
Company<br><br>
Investment in infrastructure is expected
to reach $60 trillion by 2030. Success
requires technology, services and
execution delivered at scale across a
massive global footprint. With more
than $100 billion in revenue and nearly
16% margins, we are the largest
and most profi table infrastructure
company in the world. Our goal
is for infrastructure earnings to be
70% of GE’s total.<br><br>
Infrastructure is essential. Countries
must invest in infrastructure to compete
and create jobs. For instance,
Africa has a 100 gigawatt defi cit in
electricity. Only by investing in power
generation can it sustain growth.
Fortunately, Africa is surrounded by
some of the world’s largest reserves
of oil and gas. Converting “gas to
power” is its infrastructure challenge.
Only GE can provide complete solutions
to solve its electricity problem.<br><br>
In Africa, we are a productivity partner.
As a result, we are growing 30%
annually there.<br><br>
GE has a unique advantage
because of our depth and breadth.
Customers value our technical depth.
Our products are the heart of our
customers’ operations. GE’s highperformance
locomotive improves
profi tability and safety at a railroad.<br><br>
And, our unique breadth makes GE
a desirable partner. In Russia, we
are investing across fi ve business
segments. We are building local
capability to deliver local solutions.
GE is one of the largest multinationals
in the country.<br><br>

We have a set of enterprise initiatives
that capitalize on our scale and ability
to spread ideas horizontally across
GE. These initiatives are customized
for infrastructure and allow us to lead
in both share and margins. We invest
more than $10 billion each year to
reinforce this leadership.<br><br>
GE wins with technology. We
invest 5%C6% of revenue back into
new products every year. Technology
creates competitive advantage and
margins. We spread ideas through
our Global Research Center with
six locations around the world. Our
products must be both innovative
and economical. I ran our Healthcare
business in the late ’90s, and we sold
three types of MR scanners; today we
sell many more with differentiated
customer benefi ts. We know how to
deliver the best technology at every
price point with high margins.<br><br>
GE wins in growth markets. We
know how to be both global and
local. Most countries want the same
things ― competitive capabilities
that create jobs, sense of pride
and progress that lifts all people up.<br><br>
They want to tap into the global

marketplace for progress, ideas, and
the capability to export their goods.<br><br>
GE is an excellent partner as countries
grow. For instance, we opened a
new business-process center in Saudi
Arabia that will employ thousands
of local women. This is good for GE,
while making us an integral part of
the Kingdom’s economy. Last year,
growth market orders passed $40 billion
and grew by 11%. Our revenues
exceed $1 billion in 24 countries.
GE wins by delivering customer productivity.<br><br>
We understand the domain
in which our customers operate.<br><br>
Our customers want outcomes: more
power, better fuel burn, no unplanned
downtime. We deliver these outcomes.<br><br>
For instance, we have an innovation
for our power generation customers,
called the Advanced Gas Path. This
is a control and software upgrade to
our installed base. Implementing this
technology will extend our customers’
operating parameters, delivering
a 30% reduction in downtime and
saving fuel. We have a service backlog
of $180 billion, aligned with achieving
customer productivity.<br><br>
We can leverage our enterprise advantages
as we win in new infrastructure
markets, like Oil & Gas. We have grown
this business from a “standing start”
to nearly $20 billion in 15 years. We
invest on the premise that the oil and
gas industry will require the same
technical intensity and execution as
Aviation, where GE leads. We can
draw on the “GE store”― gas turbine
technology, aviation materials, healthcare
imaging, global capability ― to
solve customer problems. To win in Oil
& Gas, we have increased our R&D,
built research centers in Oklahoma City
and Brazil, and launched innovative
solutions in areas like advanced subsea
systems and enhanced oil recovery.<br><br>
We are investing in new manufacturing
capacity in Angola, Indonesia,
Brazil and Russia. Through our
service offerings, we give our customers
resilient systems that improve their
output. Our ability to turn enterprise
capabilities into profi table growth is
valuable to investors.<br><br>
The balance of our portfolio is a valuable
specialty fi nance franchise, which
we have decided to make smaller. We
settled the remaining liabilities of our
former Japanese consumer fi nance
business. This business had been
a fi nancial drag on the Company, and
our exit is a positive for investors.
And, we announced a planned split-off
of our Retail Finance business in a
capital-effi cient process beginning in 2014. We have a solid franchise in the
private label credit card business, but
it is a step removed from GE Capital’s
strength of lending to industrial
middle-market companies. By 2015, we
expect fi nancial services should be
30% of our earnings.<br><br>
GE Capital is a valuable middle-market
franchise that builds on GE strengths
and our domain expertise. We have
strong leadership franchises in areas
like equipment and inventory fi nance,
and a portion of our assets are around
GE’s installed base. This gives us
unique capability in aviation, energy
and healthcare. We link our Capital
customers to GE through a program
called “Access GE,” through which we
share our best practices to help them
run their businesses better. GE Capital
has never been stronger or safer,
and we are making substantial investments
to meet the standards expected
from a Federal Reserve regulated
fi nancial institution.<br><br>
GE’s portfolio sets our potential.
We have completed substantial work
over the past decade. We have
repositioned GE Capital as a smaller
and safer specialty fi nance leader
with less leverage and more liquidity.<br><br>
We have redeployed capital from
businesses outside the GE core ― like
insurance and media ― to platforms
that can leverage our strengths like
Oil & Gas and Life Sciences. We expect
this portfolio to deliver valuable growth
and trade at a premium in the future.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">Leading in Productivity</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We are consistently innovating inside
GE. In an “effi ciency-starved” world,
our innovations are focused on
productivity. We are investing in three
initiatives that can deliver big gains in
productivity for our customers and GE.<br><br>
We will lead as the industrial and
analytical worlds collide. We believe
that every industrial company will
become a software company; that
ultimately deep domain knowledge
is tougher to come by than writing
code. In this sense, GE seeks to link
the “iron and the data.” Our assets
have sensors that produce a customized
stream of performance data.<br><br>
We can harness this data to optimize
performance. We know that smart
machines, guided by domain-based
analytics, in a distributed setting,
will drive new levels of productivity.<br><br>
We call this the Industrial Internet.<br><br>
Our customers want our assets to
operate with no unplanned downtime
and optimal performance. Small
improvements in asset performance
could impact $20 billion of benefi ts
for our customers. We are delivering
software and analytical solutions
that can take data from our installed
base and turn it into productive
outcomes for our customers. We call
our data solutions “Predictivity,” and
so far, we have launched 24 offerings
generating $800 million of incremental
revenue. We expect Predictivity revenues
to exceed $1 billion in 2014.<br><br>
Our systems can analyze the performance
of individual engines in the
Aviation installed base; this allows us
to differentiate repairs, saving money
and time for our customers. Through
GE’s Healthcare Asset Management,
radiologists can keep “images in the
cloud.” This improves clinician productivity,
expands networks of care and

enhances diagnostic confi dence. For
our rail customers, one point of system
effi ciency is worth $2 billion of profi t
every year. In this market, GE delivers
a complete solution from dispatch
to network planning to train handling,
called RailConnect 360. We plan
to shift a substantial portion of our
repairs to “condition-based” versus
schedule-based; this will deliver
substantial savings to our customers.<br><br>
We will lead in advanced manufacturing.<br><br>
We spend about $72 billion
each year in our factories. Material
science and analytics are transforming
the way that our factories can
operate. Digital tools will make us
faster and more effi cient.<br><br>
We are investing in high-performance
computing so that we can reduce
design cycle time. We are a leader
in advanced fabrication innovations
like 3D printing, to lower product
cost and drive speed. We have
digitized our supply chain to enable
collaboration. We are at the leading
edge of robotics and automation.<br><br>
Our factories are smarter, more
distributed and reconfi gurable.<br><br>
Advanced manufacturing will create
a meaningful impact for our investors.<br><br>
Our Aviation business has a $125 billion
backlog of new products and
services. We are launching one new
engine each year for the rest of the
decade. In the past, we might have
outsourced 40% of these engines
to global suppliers; in the future, we
plan to manufacture more at GE,
capturing an increased portion of
supply chain value. Manufacturing is
the basis on which we will compete
and win in the future.<br><br>
We will lead in the “age of gas.”
Energy is becoming the major driver
of regional competitiveness. Shale gas
in the U.S. is creating electricity costs
that are substantially below the rest of
the developed world. But the U.S.
is not alone; gas is being discovered
and developed around the world.<br><br>
This is creating a “tipping point” for
fuel substitution. Gas is replacing coal
in power generation around the world
based on effi ciency and environmental
impact. Gas is replacing diesel for
distributed power and transportation.<br><br>
China plans to increase gas power
generation by 10 gigawatts annually
to clean its environment. Because
of this trend, there are billions being
invested in gas exploration, transportation
and monetization to connect
gas supply with demand. GE can
participate in every step of the gas
value chain.<br><br>
The new drivers of productivity
represent a trio of “only GE” applications.
We are the only company that is linking iron and data. We are
uniquely positioned to lead in
advanced manufacturing. And, we
can create the “total gas solution”
because we are a technical leader at
every step. We are investing to win.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T5">We Are Simplifying Everything We Do</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
To achieve our goals, we must simplify
GE. We compete across eight platforms
in 170 countries with multiple
regulators. Having lived through multiple
crisis events in the past decade, we attempted to manage volatility
through layers and reviewers. Like
many companies, we were guilty of
countering complexity with complexity:
more P&Ls, more inspectors,
multiple reviewers. Along the way, we
had created a higher-cost structure,
an artifi cial sense of risk management,
and we were insulating our people
from the heat of the market. If you
want to see where speed and accountability
go to die, watch the third review
of anything.<br><br>
We are transforming GE around the
“culture of simplifi cation.” This is not
a reorganization or an initiative. Rather,
it defi nes the way we make decisions,
work together and work with our customers.
We are focused on effi ciency,
speed and market impact. We are
driving decisions closer to markets and
making our teams accountable for
outcomes, not process.<br><br>
We are driving a leaner structure. In
administration, less is more. We have
learned that fewer layers, simpler rules
and more fi eld empowerment actually
improve execution and accountability.<br><br>
Every decision should have no
more than two approvers: We should
empower the experts in the market,
reinforced by governance and best
practice sharing. In addition, we plan
to execute the majority of our administrative
processes through shared
services, with common standards
across our businesses. This will make
us more competitive. We expect to
reduce our administrative overhead
cost by $4 billion between 2012 and
2016. Ultimately, we will end up with
selling and administrative cost of 12%
of revenue; this is a world-class benchmark.<br><br>
Our Power & Water business
is reducing its overhead by more than
20%, while increasing its number of
new products and growing share. Our
Healthcare business has eliminated
one-third of its P&Ls, while improving
customer responsiveness. We are
creating more value with lower cost.<br><br>
All processes are faster. We have
combined the principles of Lean Six
Sigma with the culture of “The Lean
Startup,” from Silicon Valley, in a process
called FastWorks. It is based
on fast action, quick adjustments and
measured outcomes. FastWorks accelerates
impact, learning, improvement
and validation. Dual-fuel power generation
is an important product gap
for our Distributed Power business. Our
initial approach was an investment
of $350 million and seven years of
development. Using FastWorks, we
will be in the market in 2014, while
investing a fraction of the initial estimate.<br><br>
FastWorks is catching fi re inside
GE across multiple processes, improving
speed and competitiveness.<br><br>
We are increasing customer intensity.<br><br>
We have reconfi gured all of our
commercial processes to work at
market speed. Our commercial teams
are empowered to lead, supported by
enabling functions that are measured
on market success. We have
increased the number of experts in
the fi eld to deliver for our customers.<br><br>
Because we have invested in our
growth market framework, we can move commercial decisions closer to
the customer. In our Aviation services
business, 75% of the fl ow commercial
deals are approved in the regions
with quick turnaround. Our Company
is beginning to feel the market speed.<br><br>
In a digital world, the major source of
scale advantage derives from a lean
backroom structure with a foundation
of information. GE will be a major benefi
ciary of cloud computing, simplifi ed
systems and mobility.<br><br>
We will still make a few mistakes. But
the biggest risks at GE are the inability
to seize market opportunities,
layers that block reality and leaders
who are not personally accountable.<br><br>
Simplification is making us
more competitive.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">We Are Delivering for Investors</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Executing our initiatives will deliver
results for investors. We would like investors to view our fi nancial performance
as a multi-year plan with
substantial progress reached each
quarter and year. By 2016, we expect
to have 70% of GE’s earnings from
our industrial businesses. We expect
to have industrial margins and returns
exceeding 17%, at the top of our peers.<br><br>
We expect GE Capital to generate good
returns while delivering cash to the
parent. We expect to generate more
than $90 billion of cash to allocate,
returning the majority of that to you in
dividends and buyback. And, we plan
to grow EPS each year.<br><br>
We made progress in 2013. We earned
$24.5 billion of segment profi t, up 7%.
We grew operating EPS by 9% and
returned $18 billion to you through dividends
and share repurchase. We ran the
Company well, with margins expanding
by 60 basis points and $17 billion of cash
generation, excluding NBCUniversal
deal-related taxes. GE Capital fi nished
the year with Tier 1 capital above 11%
and $75 billion of liquidity. <br><br>

Our industrial segment earnings grew
5%. Performance was broad-based
with four businesses growing earnings
10% or more: Aviation, Oil & Gas,
Transportation and Appliances &
Lighting. We ended the year with
$244 billion in backlog, a record.
GE Capital grew its earnings by 12%,
behind strong performance in Real
Estate and international lending and
leasing. We continued to shrink our
balance sheet; ending net investment
was $380 billion at year-end, down
more than 40% from our pre-crisis
peak. With a shrinking balance sheet
and massive fi nancial strength,
GE Capital was able to pay a $6 billion
dividend to the parent.<br><br>
Our total shareholder return expanded
by 38% in 2013, ahead of the market.
We added $64 billion of market cap
and, at $282 billion, are the sixth most
valuable company in the world. At
year-end, we increased our dividend
by 16%.<br><br>
In 2014, we have planned for our
industrial earnings to grow by more
than 10%. We expect organic revenue
growth between 4%C7%. The big
initiatives will fuel our success. Growth
market orders expanded by 11%
in 2013; this will translate into solid
revenue growth. Our service revenue
is $45 billion, and we expect solid revenue
growth in 2014. We are planning
for another year of substantial margin
enhancement, beyond the 15.7% we
achieved in 2013.<br><br>
Margins have been an area of focus
for GE. A decade ago, during the
power bubble, we had artifi cially high
margins. This has now been reset, and
we have been making steady progress.<br><br>
Through simplifi cation, we have
made substantial reductions in structural
cost. FastWorks is focused on
equipment margins, which will be up
substantially this year. We are restructuring
our lower-margin businesses
with a target of at least 10% margins
for them in the near term.
GE Capital’s earnings will decline in
2014 and 2015 as we exit Retail
Finance. However, we plan to grow

earnings in line with industrial growth
thereafter. Our specialty fi nance
franchises have strong positions with
mid-market customers. We can originate
new businesses at high margins.<br><br>
We should have more than $90 billion
of cash to allocate over the next
three years, based on CFOA growth,
balance-sheet effi ciency, GE Capital
dividends, and dispositions. We plan
to return the majority of this cash
to investors. Growing the GE dividend
remains most important to the
majority of investors. We will reduce
our share count, aiming for a 10%
reduction between 2012 and 2015.<br><br>
We will accelerate growth through
“bolt-on” acquisitions. Early in the year,
we announced the purchase of Thermo
Fisher’s bioprocess manufacturing
business in Healthcare, and Cameron’s
reciprocating compressor business
in Oil & Gas. Both fi t our model of
opportunistic purchases where GE
adds value through technology, global
distribution and supply chain scale.<br><br>
Importantly, they allow us to complete
market solutions for our customers.
Our plans for 2014 and beyond should
be attractive to investors. You will see
steady EPS growth, with a more valuable
mix. We have substantial cash
available to create shareholder value.<br><br>
I am investing right alongside of you.
I have invested my entire bonus in GE
stock and have purchased 145,000
shares so far this year. I now own 2
million shares outright, with another
2.8 million available if we perform. Like
the rest of our leaders, I believe in GE.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
What defi nes progress? For GE, it means improving the way the world works.<br><br>
We do this by leading in infrastructure; by combining industrial capabilities
with analytical smarts to launch products that optimize effi ciencies; and by
simplifying processes, enabling us to more quickly respond to market shifts
and to collaborate more closely. We defi ne progress as the ability to better
compete, innovate and perform. At GE, we are successful―not because we
are perfect―but because we make progress. This is a commitment we make
to our customers, employees, shareholders and the world.<br><br>

Scale of an Infrastructure Leader<br><br>


GE builds, moves, powers and cures the world. We are the global leader in
infrastructure, developing and changing markets. For example, GE Aviation’s
portfolio of engine technologies is helping improve air travel for customers
in the Middle East. At the 2013 Dubai Air Show, GE and its partners, CFM
International (GE and Safran) and the Engine Alliance (GE and Pratt & Whitney),
won more than $40 billion (list price) in commitments for advanced, fueleffi
cient jet engines. We lead in infrastructure because our products are
essential to our customers’ operations ― and to the economic vitality of
every country and region in which we operate.<br><br>

Leading in Productivity<br><br>
Productivity drives wealth creation for the world. Just a 1% change
in energy consumption and capital expenditures can create
billions of dollars of savings across industries. At GE, we win with
innovations that are focused on productivity. We’re creating
efficiencies for our customers and for our Company with the power
of the Industrial Internet, with advanced manufacturing techniques,
and by taking a leadership position in the age of natural gas.<br><br>


Simpler Company<br><br>

At GE, we think simpler is better. Simplification means quicker
execution and closer collaboration with customers. It’s a focus on
efficiency, speed and market impact. With fewer layers and more
field empowerment, we’re putting accountability where it matters.<br><br>
We’re bringing new ideas to market at a faster pace. And we are
increasing customer intensity throughout the Company, so that all
of us―from commercial teams to enabling functions―are aligned
with market success.<br><br>

DYNAMIC TOOLS<br><br>
FOR FAST GROWTH<br><br>
What happens when we combine a Silicon
Valley startup mindset with Lean Six Sigma?<br><br>
The answer is FastWorks―a set of tools and
processes to develop new products quickly,
achieve better outcomes for our customers,
and drive quality and competitive advantage.<br><br>
FastWorks was behind our co-creation with
Chevron and Los Alamos National Laboratory
of a new solution for fl ow metering in multiphase
oil wells. In less than a year, we went
from a problem statement to prototypes, and
we now have an alliance with Chevron to
commercialize the resulting product. Known
as the GE Safi re fl ow meter, it will extend the
benefi ts of better reservoir management to
the entire oil and gas industry.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">Management’s Discussion of Financial Responsibility</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
<a href= "pic05.html">Summary of Operating Segments</a><br><br>
	
We believe that great companies are built on a foundation of
reliable fi nancial information and compliance with the spirit and
letter of the law. For General Electric Company, that foundation
includes rigorous management oversight of, and an unyielding
dedication to, controllership. The fi nancial disclosures in this
report are one product of our commitment to high-quality
fi nancial reporting. In addition, we make every effort to adopt
appropriate accounting policies, we devote our full resources
to ensuring that those policies are applied properly and consistently
and we do our best to fairly present our fi nancial results in
a manner that is complete and understandable.<br><br>
Members of our corporate leadership team review each of
our businesses routinely on matters that range from overall
strategy and fi nancial performance to staffi ng and compliance.<br><br>
Our business leaders monitor fi nancial and operating systems,
enabling us to identify potential opportunities and concerns at
an early stage and positioning us to respond rapidly. Our Board
of Directors oversees management’s business conduct, and our
Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors,
oversees our internal control over fi nancial reporting. We
continually examine our governance practices in an effort to
enhance investor trust and improve the Board’s overall effectiveness.<br><br>
The Board and its committees annually conduct a
performance self-evaluation and recommend improvements. Our
lead director chaired three meetings of our independent directors
this year, helping us sharpen our full Board meetings to better
cover signifi cant topics. Compensation policies for our executives
are aligned with the long-term interests of GE investors.<br><br>
We strive to maintain a dynamic system of internal controls
and procedures―including internal control over fi nancial
reporting―designed to ensure reliable fi nancial recordkeeping,
transparent fi nancial reporting and disclosure, and protection of
physical and intellectual property. We recruit, develop and retain
a world-class fi nancial team. Our internal audit function, including
members of our Corporate Audit Staff, conducts thousands
of fi nancial, compliance and process improvement audits each
year. Our Audit Committee oversees the scope and evaluates the
overall results of these audits, and members of that Committee
regularly attend GE Capital Board of Directors, Corporate Audit
Staff and Controllership Council meetings. Our global integrity
policies―“The Spirit & The Letter”―require compliance with law
and policy, and pertain to such vital issues as upholding fi nancial
integrity and avoiding confl icts of interest. These integrity
policies are available in 29 languages, and are provided to all of
our employees, holding each of them accountable for compliance.<br><br>
Our strong compliance culture reinforces these efforts by
requiring employees to raise any compliance concerns and by
prohibiting retribution for doing so. To facilitate open and candid
communication, we have designated ombudspersons throughout
the Company to act as independent resources for reporting
integrity or compliance concerns. We hold our directors, consultants,
agents and independent contractors to the same
integrity standards.<br><br>

We are keenly aware of the importance of full and open
presentation of our fi nancial position and operating results, and
rely for this purpose on our disclosure controls and procedures,
including our Disclosure Committee, which comprises senior
executives with detailed knowledge of our businesses and the
related needs of our investors. We ask this committee to review
our compliance with accounting and disclosure requirements,
to evaluate the fairness of our fi nancial and non-fi nancial disclosures,
and to report their fi ndings to us. We further ensure
strong disclosure by holding approximately 400 analyst and
investor meetings annually.<br><br>
We welcome the strong oversight of our fi nancial reporting
activities by our independent registered public accounting
fi rm, KPMG LLP, engaged by and reporting directly to the Audit
Committee. U.S. legislation requires management to report
on internal control over fi nancial reporting and for auditors to
render an opinion on such controls. Our report follows and the
KPMG LLP report for 2013 appears on the following page.<br><br>
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting<br><br>
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over fi nancial reporting for the
Company. With our participation, an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over fi nancial reporting was
conducted as of December 31, 2013, based on the framework and
criteria established in Internal Control―Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in 1992.<br><br>
Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded
that our internal control over fi nancial reporting was effective as
of December 31, 2013.<br><br>
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued
an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting.

展览规模：云集来自40多个国家的2213家参展商，130架飞行器亮相，吸引超过35万名专业人士和普通观众<br><br>
展会介绍：巴黎航展创办于1909年，由法国航空航天工业协会主办，每两年举办一次，是世界上历史最悠久，规模最大、最具影响的航展。<br><br>

新华网巴黎6月23日电   （记者 李明）第50届巴黎-布尔歇国际航空航天展览会（巴黎航展）23日在巴黎北部郊区的布尔歇机场落幕。回顾此次航展，民用宽体客机、无人驾驶飞机和俄罗斯军机吸引眼球，惹人关注。<br><br>

　　宽体客机：空客波音争霸<br><br>

　　上一届巴黎航展，民用客机的主角是欧洲制造商空中客车（空客）公司推出的环保节能型单通道飞机A320neo。今年巴黎航展，中远程宽体客机成为主角，空客及其竞争对手波音为此使尽浑身解数。<br><br>

　　目前，波音在中远程宽体客机市场方面略占上风，787“梦想客机”2011年9月投入使用，已获900多架订单；第二款机型787－9预计今年晚些时候首飞。今年巴黎航展，波音搬来卡塔尔和印度航空公司各一架787实体客机，或作静态展示，或作飞行表演。此外，波音还宣布正式启动787－10项目，计划于2018年推出第三款机型787－10X，目的是保持领先优势。<br><br>

　　面对波音咄咄逼人的气势，空客毫不示弱。本届巴黎航展开幕前三天，空客新研制的A350XWB在法国图卢兹首飞成功，这架飞机随后飞临巴黎上空，公开亮相。虽然A350XWB实体飞机无法与公众进行零距离接触，但仍然博得眼球，成为本届航展的一个亮点。<br><br>

　　在订单方面，空客A350XWB在本届航展上获得69架订单，价值214亿美元。而波音收获102架787－10和13架777－300ER订单，价值343亿美元。不过，空客表示，A350XWB市场潜力巨大，在过去五年中所获订单数与波音787在同期所获订单数的比例为2比1。<br><br>

　　分析人士指出，在中远程航线上，航空公司需要在不增加航班次数的情况下，通过运送更多旅客来满足不断增长的市场需求。这一市场的需求和盈利空间均较大，空客和波音作为全球具备生产这一类型客机的两家制造商，将保持比较激烈的竞争。<br><br>

马航MH370航班：波音777-200<br><br>

波音777飞机是一种远程飞机，于20世纪90年代首次进入服务业领域。自2004年以来的统计表明，波音777型飞机致命事故发生次数较少，而马来西亚航空公司也不在近年事故多发的航空公司行列。MH370航班的239个生命，背后是许多期待亲人归来的家庭。<br><br>

　　波音777是一款由美国波音公司制造的长程双引擎广体客机，为世界首架无图纸、无模型、用电子计算机设计的新型双发动机客机。MH370次航班所用波音777-200型客机最大油箱117340升，最大起飞总重230吨，最大航程9520公里，动力装置为两台涡扇发动机。<br><br>

此次马航MH370航班涉及的客机机型为波音777-200，这个机型从既往飞行数据来看，安全性是相当高的。<br><br>

据BBC报道，波音777在韩亚空难之前近20年内都没出现过致命事故。<br><br>

　　除了2013年韩亚空难以外，波音777-200出过最严重的一次事故是2008年1月，在英国航空一架从北京发往伦敦的航班上，管道供热的燃气交换器出了事故，管道出现结冰现象，从而导致燃油流量下降，发动机动力减小，最终几乎两个发动机都失去了动力，但飞机最终迫降成功。从技术角度来看，迫降成功可以证明这个机型的飞机性能是非常好的。<br><br>

无人飞机：各国竞相发展<br><br>

　　本届巴黎航展，无人驾驶飞机引起各方关注，特别是欧洲六国研发的“神经元”无人驾驶战斗机首次在航展上亮相，以及中国航空工业集团公司（中航工业）展示的“翼龙”多功能无人机实体机。<br><br>

　　目前，世界上有30多个国家在从事无人机的研究和生产，已有50多个国家使用无人机。其中，美国、以色列、俄罗斯三国在这一领域处于领先地位，并展开激烈竞争。欧洲国家不愿过多依赖美国技术，从2003年开始启动“神经元”项目，联合研发无人驾驶战斗机。法国希望无人机能够在2030年装备空军。<br><br>

　　在法国、意大利、西班牙、瑞士、瑞典和希腊六个欧洲国家共同努力下，“神经元”无人驾驶战斗机2012年12月初完成首飞，并以实体机在巴黎航展上进行静态展示。有媒体称，这款无人机具有可探测性雷达的特征，能够自动飞行并获取攻击目标。分析人士指出，“神经元”无人机未必具有如此高的人工智能，但试飞成功和实体机展示，表明欧洲国家决心发展自己的无人驾驶战斗机。
<br><br>
　　中航工业研发的“翼龙”无人机在2007年10月完成首飞，今年首度以实体机在巴黎航展上作展示。中航工业负责人表示，该公司非常重视发展无人机产业，近年来投入大量研发力量开发无人机产品，并推出多种产品。“翼龙”无人机总体性能已经达到了国际上同类型无人机的先进水平。“无人机需求非常大，这个产业也刚刚起步，世界各国都想掌握最先进的技术，我们希望展现中国航空工业的实力，”这位负责人说。<br><br>

军用战机：俄罗斯重装回归<br><br>

　　受美国政府削减财政支出影响，美国空军今年缺席巴黎航展。而逐渐恢复元气的俄罗斯军事航空工业则重装回归，带来了苏－35战斗机、雅克130军事教练机和卡－52武装直升机等产品。<br><br>

　　俄罗斯军用战机中最引人注目的是苏－35战斗机和卡－52武装直升机。苏－35战斗机以出色的机动性，在飞行表演中完成各种特技，让现场观众赞不绝口。卡－52武装直升机由俄罗斯卡莫夫设计局研发，采用同轴反转双旋翼、无尾桨的经典设计。该机首次以实体机参加巴黎航展，并携外挂进行飞行表演，也受到现场观众热捧。<br><br>

　　俄罗斯航空工业历来是世界航空工业中一支重要力量。苏联鼎盛时期建立起强大的航空工业体系，能够研制、试验、生产几乎所有类型的现代航空装备。但苏联解体后，航空工业深受重创。近年来，俄罗斯航空工业进行了国有化整合，逐渐恢复元气。<br><br>

　　分析人士指出，俄罗斯正在努力重返世界航空制造业的第一集团行列。目前，该国仍在军事航空领域保持较高的研发和生产水平，但民用航空工业由于伤筋动骨，恢复昔日水平还需要时间。
<br><br>
 【俄罗斯之声电台网站6月22日报道】题：俄罗斯征服了布尔歇（记者 纳塔利娅・科瓦连科）
<br><br>
俄罗斯飞机的航空展演征服了布尔歇。雅克-130教练机、卡-52“短吻鳄”武装直升机、苏-35战斗机均首次向外国公众亮相，震撼了专家和观众。
<br><br>
在布尔歇机场举行的第50届巴黎航展上，俄罗斯派出了近年来最强大的参展阵容。俄方共有46家公司参展，苏霍伊、米格、伊尔、伊尔库特、安泰、俄罗斯国防产品出口公司等著名军工厂商悉数到场。在展厅、露天展场和航空表演过程中，观众得以目睹俄罗斯航空工业的最新成就。
<br><br>
此次航展上，苏-35首次在国外进行飞行表演。苏-35是当今世界上最强悍的第四代战机，配备30毫米口径机炮，雷达最大搜索范围超过400公里，在不进行空中加油的情况下航程可达3500公里以上。强大的发动机使其可以完成各种超高难度动作，包括横滚、平面螺旋、“普加乔夫眼镜蛇”等特技。它还有独一无二的绝活――“摊煎饼”：在水平方向不减速的情况下突然进行360度调头飞行。西方媒体惊呼：“这不是飞机，简直就是UFO。”
<br><br>
联合飞机制造公司总裁米哈伊尔・波戈相院士对苏-35的此次亮相非常满意。他说：“苏-35超出所有第四代机型，其性能不仅体现于卓越的空气动力学工艺水平上，还体现在独特的机载设备和攻击能力方面。这还不是我们的最新成果，因为我们还在同时研制第五代战机。这两种机型未来可实现互补，提升俄罗斯和使用俄制武器国家的空军战力。”
<br><br>
据悉，本次巴黎航展期间已达成约100架苏-35出口协议。
<br><br>
卡-52“短吻鳄”直升机是此次航展的另一个新面孔。这是一种全天候侦察攻击直升机，可摧毁任何地面目标和空中低速目标。俄公司已收到卡-52的首批正式询价函，尽管竞争对手在航展表演时大耍花招：当卡-52已经启动发动机准备升空时，表演突然被取消，取而代之的是德法联合研制的“虎”式直升机表演。等轮到卡-52表演时，观众已散去大半。
<br><br>
中型干线客机MS-21也引起了业内人士的关注，这种客机将在市场上与波音和空客一争高下。MS-21是“21世纪干线飞机”的缩写，专家认为其出口前景相当乐观。
<br><br>
除飞行表演外，俄方专业人士还在此次航展上向外国客户展示了当今俄罗斯国内最新航空航天技术设备。
<br><br>
俄罗斯特技飞行研究中心总设计师、功勋试飞员阿纳托利・科沃丘尔表示，俄罗斯公司借本次航展提升了俄航空工业的形象。他说：“任何一次展览都是为了争夺市场。此外，这也是各大国科研、技术和生产水平的一次展示，俄罗斯理应向世界证明，它仍然是航空工业大国之一。如果说在1989年我们只是与美法两个国家竞争的话，那么今天我们还要和中国、巴西同台竞技。”
<br><br>
初步统计显示，俄罗斯公司此次在布尔歇的签约金额高达26亿美元。共有来自44个国家的2000多家公司在本次航展上展示了自己的军用和民用航空航天设备。
