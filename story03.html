Our Mission<br><br>


The mission of the United States Air Force is to fly, fight and win … in air, space and cyberspace.<br><br>

To achieve that mission, the Air Force has a vision of Global Vigilance, Reach and Power. That vision orbits around three core competencies: developing Airmen, technology to war fighting and integrating operations. These core competencies make our six distinctive capabilities possible.<br><br>

Air and Space Superiority<br><br>
With it, joint forces can dominate enemy operations in all dimensions: land, sea, air and space.<br><br>

Global Attack<br><br>
Because of technological advances, the Air Force can attack anywhere, anytime and do so quickly and with greater precision than ever before.<br><br>

Rapid Global Mobility<br><br>
Being able to respond quickly and decisively anywhere we're needed is key to maintaining rapid global mobility.

Precision Engagement<br><br>
The essence lies in the ability to apply selective force against specific targets because the nature and variety of future contingencies demand both precise and reliable use of military power with minimal risk and collateral damage.
<br><br>
Information Superiority<br><br>
The ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan is crucial.
<br><br>
Agile Combat Support<br><br>
Deployment and sustainment are keys to successful operations and cannot be separated. Agile combat support applies to all forces, from those permanently based to contingency buildups to expeditionary forces.
<br><br>
Core Values<br><br>
The Air Force bases these core competencies and distinctive capabilities on a shared commitment to three values: Integrity first, Service before self, and Excellence in all we do.<br><br>

	<hr><br>

Whoever you are and wherever you fit on the Air Force team, the Core Values are what you will live by and learn to cherish.<br><br>

The Core Values are much more than minimum standards. They remind us what it takes to get the mission done. They inspire us to do our very best at all times. They are the common bond among all comrades in arms, and they are the glue that unifies the Force and ties us to the great warriors and public servants of the past.
<br><br>
The First Core Value: Integrity First<br><br>

The Second Core Value: Service Before Self<br><br>

The Third Core Value: Excellence In All We Do<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">The First Core Value: Integrity First</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Airman is a person of integrity, courage and conviction.<br><br>

Integrity is a character trait. It is the willingness to do what is right even when no one is looking. It is the moral compass, the inner voice, the voice of self-control and the basis for the trust imperative in today's military.
<br><br>
Integrity is the ability to hold together and properly regulate all of the elements of a personality. A person of integrity, for example, is capable of acting on conviction. A person of integrity can control impulses and appetites.
<br><br>
But integrity also covers several other moral traits indispensable to national service.
<br><br>
Courage<br><br>
A person of integrity possesses moral courage and does what is right even if the personal cost is high.
<br><br>
Honesty<br><br>
Honesty is the hallmark of the military professional because in the military, our word must be our bond. We don't pencil-whip training reports, we don't cover up tech data violations, we don't falsify documents and we don't write misleading operational readiness messages. The bottom line is: We don't lie, and we can't justify any deviation.
<br><br>
Responsibility<br><br>
No person of integrity is irresponsible; a person of true integrity acknowledges his/her duties and acts accordingly.
<br><br>
Accountability<br><br>
No person of integrity tries to shift the blame to others or take credit for the work of others. "The buck stops here" says it best.<br><br>

Justice<br><br>
A person of integrity practices justice. Those who do similar things must get similar rewards or similar punishments.
<br><br>
Openness<br><br>
Professionals of integrity encourage a free flow of information within the organization. They seek feedback from all directions to ensure they are fulfilling key responsibilities, and they are never afraid to allow anyone at any time to examine how they do business.
<br><br>
Self-respect<br><br>
To have integrity is also to respect oneself as a professional and a human being. A person of integrity does not behave in ways that would bring discredit upon himself/herself or the organization to which he/she belongs.
<br><br>
Humility<br><br>
A person of integrity grasps and is sobered by the awesome task of defending the Constitution of the United States of America.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">The Second Core Value: Service Before Self</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
An Airman's professional duties always take precedence over personal desires.
<br><br>
Service before self tells us that professional duties take precedence over personal desires. At the very least, it includes the following behaviors:
<br><br>
Rule following<br><br>
To serve is to do one's duty, and our duties are most commonly expressed through rules. While it may be the case that professionals are expected to exercise judgment in the performance of their duties, good professionals understand that rules have a reason for being - and the default position must be to follow those rules unless there is a clear, operational reason for refusing to do so.
<br><br>
Respect for others<br><br>
Service before self tells us also that a good leader places the troops ahead of his/her personal comfort. We must always act in the certain knowledge that all persons possess a fundamental worth as human beings.
<br><br>
Discipline and self-control<br><br>
Professionals cannot indulge themselves in self-pity, discouragement, anger, frustration or defeatism. They have a fundamental moral obligation to the persons they lead to strike a tone of confidence and forward-looking optimism. More specifically, they are expected to exercise control in the following areas:
<br><br>
Anger<br><br>
Military professionals and especially commanders at all echelons are expected to refrain from displays of anger that would bring discredit upon themselves and/or the Air Force.
<br><br>
Appetites<br><br>
Those who allow their appetites to drive them to make sexual overtures to subordinates are unfit for military service. Likewise, the excessive consumption of alcohol casts doubt on an individual's fitness.
<br><br>
Religious toleration<br><br>
Military professionals must remember that religious choice is a matter of individual conscience. Professionals - and especially commanders - must not take it upon themselves to change or coercively influence the religious views of subordinates.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T5">The Third Core Value: Excellence In All We Do</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Every American Airman strives for continual improvement in self and service.
<br><br>
Excellence in all we do directs us to develop a sustained passion for continuous improvement and innovation that will propel the Air Force into a long-term, upward spiral of accomplishment and performance.
<br><br>
Product/service excellence<br><br>
We must focus on providing services and generating products that fully respond to customer wants and anticipate customer needs, and we must do so within the boundaries established by the tax-paying public.
<br><br>
Personal excellence<br><br>
Military professionals must seek out and complete professional military education, stay in physical and mental shape and continue to refresh their general educational backgrounds.
<br><br>
Community excellence<br><br>
Community excellence is achieved when the members of an organization can work together to successfully reach a common goal in an atmosphere that is free from fear and that preserves individual self-worth. Some of the factors influencing interpersonal excellence are:
<br><br>
Mutual respect<br><br>
Genuine respect involves viewing another person as an individual of fundamental worth. Obviously, this means that a person is never judged on the basis of his/her possession of an attribute that places him/her in some racial, ethnic, economic or gender-based category.
<br><br>
Benefit of the doubt<br><br>
Working hand in glove with mutual respect is that attitude that says all coworkers are innocent until proven guilty. Before rushing to judgment about a person or his/her behavior, it is important to have the whole story.
<br><br>
Resources excellence<br><br>
Excellence in all we do also demands that we aggressively implement policies to ensure the best possible cradle-to-grave management of resources.
<br><br>
Material resources excellence<br><br>
Military professionals have an obligation to ensure that all of the equipment and property they ask for is mission essential. This means that residual funds at the end of the year should not be used to purchase "nice to have" add-ons.
<br><br>
Human resources excellence<br><br>
Human resources excellence means that we recruit, train, promote and retain those who can do the best job for us.
<br><br>
Operations excellence<br><br>
There are two kinds of operations excellence: internal and external.
<br><br>
Excellence of internal operations<br><br>
This form of excellence pertains to the way we do business internal to the Air Force from the unit level to Air Force Headquarters. It involves respect on the unit level and a total commitment to maximizing the Air Force team effort.
<br><br>
Excellence of external operations<br><br>
This form of excellence pertains to the way in which we treat the world around us as we conduct our operations. In peacetime, for example, we must be sensitive to the rules governing environmental pollution, and in wartime we are required to obey the laws of war.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">Mission of the Navy</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The mission of the Navy is to maintain, train and equip combat-ready Naval forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression and maintaining freedom of the seas.
<br><br>
“谁控制了海洋，谁就控制了贸易；谁控制了世界贸易，谁就控制了世界的财富，最后也就控制了世界本身。”<br><br>
Sir Walter Raleigh declared in the early 17th century that "whoever commands the sea, commands the trade; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself."<br><br>


Domination of the maritime domain
<br><br>
Today, the U.S. Navy has the distinction of being the world’s premier naval power. Complete with the big ships that one would most commonly associate with it. But to really understand why there’s a need for a sea-based military organization in this day and age, just consider that:<br><br>
70% of the earth is covered in water<br><br>
80% of the planet’s population lives within close proximity to coastal areas<br><br>
90% of global commerce is conducted by sea<br><br>

Any way you look at it, supremacy on the waterways of the world will always be critical. And whether it’s by way of oceans, canals, rivers or littoral areas, there remains a great need for the Navy to be out there:<br><br>
Serving as a guardian for America’s freedom and defending the life we know<br><br>
Supporting the cause of liberty abroad and promoting peace for all humanity<br><br>
Enabling the safe travel of people and goods to meet the expanding demands of globalization<br><br>


Expansion of the seapower concept<br><br>

America’s Navy is unique in that it conducts missions on all fronts: in the air, on land and at sea. Fulfilling a broad role that encompasses everything from combat to peacekeeping to humanitarian assistance C in theater, on bases and everywhere from the cockpits of F-18’s to the control-rooms of nuclear submarines.<br><br>

Wherever a military presence is needed, the Navy is there. Whenever a situation requires U.S. involvement, the Navy is often the first to deploy, the first to engage and the first to help. Always on call and standing by to:<br><br>
Utilize its force of highly skilled Sailors in whatever capacity is called for<br><br>
Serve as an operational platform for anything from military missions to disaster relief<br><br>
Transport uniformed military personnel and equipment<br><br>


America was founded on the principles of courage, equality and fairness. And for well over 200 years, America’s Navy has been instrumental in presenting these ideals to the world C through the selfless service of upstanding men and women; through their responsible use of incredibly powerful capabilities; and through the pride, purpose and professionalism that comes through in all they do.<br><br>


Here, learn what it means to be part of America’s Navy. A Global Force For Good. Get a sense of the Navy’s ongoing mission, history and traditions. Meet the current Navy leadership. Plus, check out the many locations around the globe where the Navy does its work C and the types of awesome equipment that are employed to get the job done.<br><br>

Through words and testimonials, pictures and videos, historical facts and breaking news, you’ll find a clear demonstration of who and what America’s Navy is C and beyond that C why its presence is so important.<br><br>

A Global Force For Good<br><br>

The strength and status of any nation can be measured in part by the will and might of its navy. That’s not an outdated thought; it’s a modern reality. As the largest, most versatile, most capable naval force on the planet today, America’s Navy epitomizes this idea. And yet, far more impressive is what it does with the distinction. 
<br><br>


A symbol of power, a force for stability
<br><br>
America’s Navy serves as an essential force of stability in an increasingly unstable and interconnected world C as well as a vanguard for positive change. Why is this important? Because what America’s Navy does each and every day makes the world as we know it possible.<br><br>


First to fight, first to help<br><br>

The role of America’s Navy is both vast and dependent upon circumstance. It involves everything from engaging in combat and warfare support, to keeping waterways safe and open for global commerce, to deterring sea piracy and drug trafficking. And when called upon, it’s a force that readily answers the need for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief anywhere, anytime C to help American citizens and citizens of the world.
<br><br>

A job of immense importance<br><br>

The specific responsibilities of America’s Navy are carried out by the hundreds of thousands of Sailors who work tirelessly to achieve the highest standards of excellence in hundreds of diverse career fields. Putting professional skills to work to advance the Navy’s cause as well as their own interests. To win wars as well as win over hearts and minds.<br><br>


A nation at its absolute best<br><br>

Exceptional people. Leading technology. Incredible capabilities. All focused on making the world a better place. When it all comes together, this is what makes America’s Navy what it truly is. Something more than an admirable calling. More than a promising career choice. More than an elite military power.
<br><br>

The Navy falls under the administration of the Department of the Navy, under civilian leadership of the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV). The most senior naval officer is the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), a four-star admiral who is immediately under and reports to the Secretary of the Navy. At the same time, the Chief of Naval Operations is one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is the second-highest deliberatory body of the armed forces after the United States National Security Council, although it only plays an advisory role to the President and does not nominally form part of the chain of command. The Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations are responsible for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the Navy so that it is ready for operation under the command of the unified combat command commanders.

Ray Mabus<br><br>


Office Term: 5/19/2009 - Present
<br><br>



Ray Mabus is the 75th United States Secretary of the Navy and leads America's Navy and Marine Corps.
<br><br>
 As Secretary of the Navy, Mabus is responsible for conducting the affairs of the Department of the Navy, including recruiting, organizing, equipping, training and mobilizing. Additionally, he oversees the construction and repair of naval ships, aircraft, and facilities, and formulates and implements policies and programs consistent with the national security policies established by the President and the Secretary of Defense. Secretary Mabus is responsible for an annual budget in excess of $170 billion and leadership of almost 900,000 people.
<br><br>
 Upon assumption of office and throughout his tenure, Mabus has prioritized improving the quality of life of Sailors, Marines and their families, decreasing the Department’s dependence on fossil fuels, strengthening partnerships and revitalizing the Navy’s shipbuilding program.
<br><br>
 Leading the world's only global Navy, Mabus has traveled more than 800 thousand miles to over 100 countries to maintain and develop relationships with national and international officials and visit with Sailors and Marines forward deployed or stationed around the world.  He has traveled to Afghanistan on 12 separate occasions, in recognition of the sacrifice and service of Sailors and Marines deployed in combat zones.
<br><br>
 To prepare service members and their families for the high tempo operations of today’s Navy and Marine Corps, Mabus announced in 2012 the “21st Century Sailor and Marine” initiative, designed to build and maintain the most resilient and ready force possible.
<br><br>
 Mabus also directed the Navy and Marine Corps to change the way they use, produce and acquire energy, and set an aggressive goal that no later than 2020, the Navy and Marine Corps obtain at least 50% of their energy from alternative sources. In pursuit of that goal the Department has achieved several milestones. In 2012, President Obama announced in his State of the Union address that the Department will purchase or facilitate the production of 1GW of renewable energy for use on Navy and Marine Corps installations. The Navy also demonstrated the Great Green Fleet in 2012, a carrier strike group in which every participating U.S. Navy ship and type of aircraft operated on alternative energy sources including nuclear energy and biofuels.
<br><br>
 Secretary Mabus has made increasing the size of the naval fleet and protecting the industrial base a top budget priority of the Department. During his tenure, the Navy went from building fewer than five ships a year to having more than 40 ships under contract, most of them in fixed-price, multi-year deals that assure value for taxpayers, certainty for industry partners and strength for our nation.
<br><br>
 In June 2010, as an additional duty, President Obama appointed Mabus to prepare the long-term recovery plan for the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Mabus’ report was released in September 2010 and met with broad bi-partisan support with most recommendations passed into law by Congress as the Restore Act. Included in the legislation was a fund to aid in the Gulf Coast’s recovery by distributing 80 percent of any civil penalties awarded as a result of the damage caused by the disaster. To date, civil penalties total more than one billion dollars.
<br><br>
 Before his appointment, Mabus held a variety of leadership positions. From 1988 to 1992, Mabus served as Governor of Mississippi, the youngest elected to that office in more than 150 years. Mabus was Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from 1994-1996 and later was Chairman and CEO of a manufacturing company.
<br><br>
 Mabus has been recognized for his leadership of the Navy and Marine Corps on multiple occasions.  In 2013, he was named one of the top 50 highest rated CEOs by Glassdoor, an online jobs and career community.  Mabus was the only leader of a federal agency to receive this award.
<br><br>
 Secretary Mabus is a native of Ackerman, Mississippi, and received a Bachelor's Degree, summa cum laude, from the University of Mississippi, a Master's Degree from Johns Hopkins University, and a Law Degree, magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School. After Johns Hopkins, Mabus served in the Navy as an officer aboard the cruiser USS Little Rock.
<br><br>

Many past and present United States historical figures have served in the navy. Notable officers include John Paul Jones, John Barry (Continental Navy officer and first flag officer of the United States Navy),[66] James Lawrence (whose last words "don't give up the ship" are memorialized in Bancroft Hall at the United States Naval Academy), Stephen Decatur, Jr., David Farragut, David Dixon Porter, Oliver Hazard Perry, Commodore Matthew Perry (whose Black Ships forced the opening of Japan), and Chester Nimitz, Admiral of the Pacific Fleet in World War II.
<br><br>
The first American president who served in the navy was John F. Kennedy (who commanded the famous PT-109). Others included Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George H. W. Bush. Both Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt were the assistant secretary of the navy prior to their presidencies. Many members of Congress served in the navy, notably U.S. Senators Bob Kerrey, John McCain, and John Kerry. Other notable former members of the U.S. Navy include astronauts, entertainers, authors and professional athletes.

He commanded USS Camden (AOE-2) from May 2003 to October 2004, USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) from August 2006 to July 2009, and Carrier Strike Group 12 (CSG-12) (USS Enterprise) from October 2011 to April 2013.<br><br>

Its principal courses of study are developed by the Strategy and Policy, National Security Affairs, and Joint Military Operations academic departments.[4] Students from all branches of the military, as well as civilian government employees, work towards a Master of Arts.<br><br>

The College offers a wide variety of challenging academic programs, each designed to focus on specific areas of study or directed at specific levels of seniority. The Joint Force Maritime Component Commander Course (JFMCC) prepares flag officers for duties as maritime component commanders by developing perspectives necessary to articulate effectively the role of the Maritime Component in the design and execution of campaign plans and theater-security efforts.
<br><br>
Seminar forums led by our nation's senior joint leadership and facilitated by senior mentors and assigned NWC faculty facilitate discussion for attendees from all services. Sessions address the practical challenges of operational-level leadership and ensure the flag and general officers gain a high degree of confidence with the concepts, systems, languages, and processes required to employ naval forces effectively in a multiservice, multiagency, and multinational environment. The Combined Force Maritime Component Commander Course (CFMCC) additionally improves the effectiveness of senior leaders who routinely function together at the operational level by incorporating flag-level peers from partner nations into the student body. Normally, CFMCC courses are conducted with a regional focus in order to develop and deepen relationships based on trust and confidence, to serve as a forum to evolve combined maritime command and control concepts and mechanisms, and to advance the understanding of those security issues facing participating nations.<br><br>

The College of Naval Warfare (CNW) is a ten-month-long senior-level PME program with JPME Phase II designed to produce broadly educated leaders who possess a strategic perspective, underpinned by strategic analytical frameworks. Graduates are able to apply disciplined, strategic-minded, critical thinking to challenges in the multiservice, multiagency, and multinational environments. Graduates are also capable strategic planners and joint war-fighters who are effective maritime advocates. All of the College's PME curricula are based on tailored versions of the three basic curricula taught by three academic departments: National Security Affairs (NSA), Strategy and Policy (S&P) and Joint Military Operations (JMO).<br><br>


The purpose of the National Security Decision Making (NSDM) and Theater Security Decision Making (TSDM) courses are to educate military officers and U.S. government civilians in effective decision-making and leadership on security issues, particularly those involving force selection and planning challenges, within national and theater resource constraints. Selection of concepts and materials is predicated on the belief that an effective commander or officer serving on a staff does not apply discrete disciplines, but rather is required to synthesize many disciplines relevant to different situations. Moreover, the appropriate point of view is an integrative one that seeks a balanced use of reasoning based on both an academic and a professional foundation. For this reason, this course employs a multidiscipline approach, synthesizing selected concepts from economics, political science, strategy, leadership, psychology, management, anthropology, and other related disciplines.<br><br>

The Strategy and Policy courses are designed to teach each student to think strategically. Further, the courses stated objective is to sharpen students' abilities to assess how alternative operational courses of action best serve to achieve overall national objectives. To achieve this, the Strategy and Policy curriculum draws on a number of disciplines, including history, economics, political science, international relations, and geography. Additionally, a multifaceted faculty composed of both accomplished academicians and military officers not only is employed in teaching the curriculum but is also actively engaged in curriculum development and refinement, strategy research, and writing on relevant topics. The curriculum itself makes use of a number of case studies which are distinctive in a few respects. First, the leading strategic thinkers and case studies examine diverse types of wars, featuring a variety of operations and different keys to success. This course shows how success in one type of war may be followed by failure in another. An important aspect of leadership is the ability to adapt to different types of wars. Second, this course analyzes the strategic successes and failures of leading great powers and non-state actors beyond the duration of military operations. Finally, this course gives special attention to maritime powers and their leaders.<br><br>


The Joint Military Operations and Joint Maritime Operations courses are in depth study of joint operations at the operational level of war throughout the range of military operations. JMO prepares students for the operational arena by emphasizing joint capabilities planning and joint force application to achieve military objectives. It examines joint operations from the standpoint of the Joint Task Force (JTF) commander with a maritime emphasis. It further develops joint attitudes and perspectives, exposing officers to, and increasing their understanding of, service cultures while concentrating on joint staff operations.<br><br>

The course focuses on enhancing the capability of officers to think and make proper decisions within the operational level of war, from the operational-strategic level through the operational-tactical level, throughout the range of military operations. Students are challenged as they apply resources to meet goals and objectives derived from U.S. national and theater military strategy. The JMO course not only serves to expand student familiarity with operational art, service capabilities, and joint doctrine, it also exposes them to a range of methods and disciplines required to employ the military instrument of power and interagency capabilities to achieve a joint force commander's (JFC) operational-level objectives. Examples of these include operational art, threat and risk assessment, the military planning process, analysis of service and joint doctrine, and the JTF staff environment.

<a href= "link03.html">暗黑政治教材</a><br><br>
<a href= "link04.html">Lyndon B. Johnson</a><br><br>

The United States Armed Forces remain unrivaled. We deter threats, assure partners, and defeat adver-saries. We are strong―and our Na-tion is secure―because we commit to being the best led, best trained, and best equipped force as our non-negotiable imperative.<br><br>
The men and women of the Joint Force―all volunteers―are our Na-tion’s qualitative military edge. We are who we are because of your commitment and determination. And you are supported by strong and resilient families. These things are true, not because they are easy, but because you have dedicated your lives to the service of our Nation.<br><br>

The world is not getting any safer, but we are becoming more adapta-ble. We are facing three transi-tions―to a different force posture, to a smaller defense budget, and for some, to civilian life. At the same time, we are facing a historic conver-gence of fiscal challenges. As a Na-tion, we are making choices to re-store the economic foundation of our national power.<br><br>
Our profession demands that we anticipate the defense needs of the Nation and remain attuned to the risks of a growing diversity of threats. Our profession continues to evolve, and we will lead its evolu-tion in the 21st century. We can on-ly lead through these transitions with the trust of the force, our fami-lies, and the American people.
This midpoint of my term as the 18th Chairman prompts an assess-ment of our work so far and informs the work we still have to do. I’d like to update you on my focus areas and how I intend to guide our activi-ties for the next two years. It builds on what you have already accom-plished. I am confident that, togeth-er, we can fortify the foundation of the future force.<br><br>

At its core, our military keeps the nation free from coercion. Whether at home or deployed, the Joint Force deters adversaries, protects our critical infrastructure, preserves the free flow of commerce, responds to crisis, and builds partner capaci-ties.<br><br>
The enduring power of the Joint Force comes from our ability to balance our re-sponse, rotation, and reset activities. Despite the current budget uncertainty, we must prioritize threats, articulate risk, and allocate resources in support of a sys-tematic and sustainable strategy.<br><br>

“We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality,<br><br>
tied in a single garment of destiny.
Whatever affects one directly, affects us all indirectly.”<br><br>

Implement and sustain national strategic guidance<br><br>
First and foremost, we will always defend the Nation. We will meet our commitments in Afghanistan.
<br><br>

We will continue to counter threats to U.S. interests from violent extremists and actively defend against Weapons of Mass Destruction and cyber attacks. We will provide military support to the U.S. Government’s pursuit of transnational criminal organizations, particu-larly along our southern flank.<br><br>
Even as we perform these important mis-sions, we must also prepare for emerging threats around the globe. We will deepen and strengthen military-to-military relationships throughout the world.<br><br>



Adapt readiness to preserve military options for the Nation<br><br>
We have to provide the Nation options. These options depend on the creativity of our people, the readiness of our forces, and the risk we are willing to underwrite.<br><br>
Achieving our national military objectives also requires that we devel-op and evolve our rela-tionships with our in-teragency and interna-tional partners. The cooperative practices we establish will play a large part in our suc-cess.<br><br>
Our prioritization of security interests drives our military planning efforts and the flexibility of resources. To generate a variety of practical options in the future, we must consider the posture of our forward-deployed and rotational forces, as well as the capacity of our Guard and Reserve forces to mobilize in support of contingencies. We will also institutionalize the new security requirements to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities abroad.<br><br>


Apply wartime lessons learned to provide best military advice and inform U.S. policy objectives and strategic guidance
The lessons we learned during the past 12 years are being applied today and will help us to adapt to the challenging days ahead. The combat-tested knowledge of the force―from battlefield leaders to combat-ant commanders―will inform the key stra-tegic documents we will develop over the next two years.<br><br>
This frontline wisdom will enhance the dialogue in operational theaters and across U.S. interagency decision-making processes. We must communicate our ca-pabilities and requirements to our Nation’s senior leaders and strengthen our civilianmilitary relationships as we provide military op-tions and articulate risk. This is the Chairman’s unique job description, but the Chairman does not shoulder this re-sponsibility alone. When I meet with the Nation’s leaders, I bring with me the sum total of the expertise and experi-ence you provide every day.<br><br>

The Joint Force of tomorrow must be able to achieve our national security objectives against a threat that is increasingly difficult to define, even as we reduce budgets.<br><br>
Our military does not face this challenge for the first time in its history, but these de-cisions are new for most of us. Moreover, our decisions will have historic impacts. We must use this period of transition to renew our commitment to the cornerstone of our military advantage―innovation and leader development.<br><br>
We created the aircraft carrier from existing capabilities after World War I and devel-oped stealth technology after the Vietnam War, during periods of similar budget re-duction. In both cases, a vision of the future guided research and development efforts, and both technologies continue to contribute to our decisive advantage.<br><br>
We need to reassess what capabilities we need most, rethink how we develop the Joint Force, and reconsider how we fight together. To sustain our strength, we will continue to protect investment in decisive capabilities, develop leaders who can adapt in the security environment of tomorrow, and innovate how we operate jointly.<br><br>

Advance a fuller vision of Joint Force 2020<br><br>
We are also increasing our effectiveness by more deliberately integrating Special Operations Forces, improving Mission Command capabilities, and moving to-ward a global Intelligence, Sur-veillance, and Reconnaissance network. We must also advance and integrate the capabilities provided by remotely-piloted systems across all domains. We will harden organizations against stress on their techno-logical systems, and train or-ganizations to be resilient should their technological systems fail.<br><br>
Our investments in cyber and a new Joint Information Environment are changing how we fight and defend the Nation, including its critical infrastructure.<br><br>

We must develop a research and devel-opment strategy that maximizes our abil-ity to nurture promising technologies and deliver them out into the force. The tech-nology bets of today, if made skillfully, will enable the force of tomorrow to remain decisive. Becoming the force of the future demands that we develop, test, and refine concepts for the future fight. We must mobilize the entire Joint Force Development enterprise to forecast those capabilities.

Undertake reforms that drive jointness further<br><br>

Fundamental to Joint Force 2020 is in-teroperability. Our capabilities, tactics, techniques, procedures, and terminology must be able to translate across the services, the interagency, and with our partner nations. We must define and en-force interoperability standards for future capabilities and build joint exercises and war games that eval-uate our ability to operate across the Joint Interagency Intergovern-mental and Multinational environ-ment.<br><br>
We know we will be a smaller force and that we must adapt to be increasingly agile.<br><br>

Our task is to carry forward those lessons learned from yesterday into the context of today. We must also establish clear interop-erability standards for innovative technolo-gies to succeed in meeting the needs of the force quickly and efficiently. Innovative solutions to joint capabil-ity gaps must be devel-oped horizontally, across the Joint Force Development enterprise, industry, and academia, and vertically, from headquarters staffs to the warfighter.
<br><br>
Our profession is grounded in our sacred oath to defend the Constitution. We remain committed to defending our Nation and the values it has pursued for more than 200 years. Generations of men and women have fought to preserve this ideal in times of peace and war, and some have given everything to protect it.<br><br>
We must hold true to these enduring values of service even as we remake our force and its capabilities. The times ahead will require more of each one of us. The cornerstone of service must be dignity and respect among all members of the force. And the mortar is leadership. We must set the example of extraordinary character and exceptional competence at every echelon.<br><br>
We will uphold the leadership, learning, and service that are the pillars of our uncommon profession. Each of these initiatives reinforces a building block of our profession. It will take each of us leading from the front to maintain it.
<br><br>
Maintain high standards of professional excellence<br><br>
The ethical decisions and proper behav-ior of each member of the Joint Force mold our professional repu-tation. Each one of us―from the private to the general―represents the whole of our profession. Our actions speak louder and echo longer than our words.<br><br>
We will continue to champion the core val-ues of the Profession of Arms, highlighting excellence in core competencies and leader attributes. We cannot overlook our obligation to one another. We must seek and share best practices to combat sexual assault, suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, and other high-risk behaviors. 
<br><br>

Maintain the high standards of education and training<br><br>
Our force is as diverse and rich in experi-ence as it has ever been. Twelve years of war have cre-ated a generation of leaders experienced in joint and in-teragency operations. The future force will require the skills and knowledge of both our battle-tested veterans and the contributions of new service members who bring fresh skills and perspectives to new ways of warfare.<br><br>

New accessions and combat veterans alike possess diverse skills and frames of reference relevant to the warfare of tomorrow. Educa-tion will serve as a hedge against surprise, much as it has during previous interwar periods. Professional Military Education should adapt to meet these dynamic needs. As we continue to advance “One University” initia-tives at National Defense University, we will update the joint PME curriculum across the force to emphasize key leader attributes. We will also explore how best to adapt our learn-ing institutions to serve a global Joint Force, evaluating degree accreditation and distance-learning delivery methods.<br><br>

Maintain the high standards of military leaders<br><br>
We will implement 360 degree reviews for all general and flag officers on the Joint Staff, to make us aware of our strengths and weaknesses and grow as leaders of the Joint Force. I will also extend these reviews to the Combatant Commanders and senior officers inbound to the Joint Staff, as well as to the O-6 and equivalent civilian personnel on the Joint Staff. These reviews serve as overt re-minders of the uncompromising standards of our conduct and the enduring tenets of our oath. We safeguard our profession reinforc-ing these principles every day.<br><br>


We keep faith with the Nation and with those who serve by making sure the Joint Force is the best led, best trained, and best equipped in the world, ready to meet any mission. We have earned pride in our exceptional performance over our years of com-bat, but we can’t presume that we have earned a blank check.<br><br>
We must balance our commitment to the Nation with the commitments we have made to the entire Military Family―Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, Veteran, Retiree, and families alike. The choices ahead must reinforce the enduring nature of our pro-fession. We must preserve the legacy of military service and promote the intangible rewards, while remaining aware of the inherent risks, of this uncommon life. Trust remains the bedrock of our profession and defines how we keep faith with our Military Family.<br><br>

Earn the trust of our people<br><br>
The health and wellbeing of our people is critical to our national security and the fu-ture of the force. We also know that we need to make changes to how we sup-port and compensate the Military Fami-ly to ensure the All Volunteer Force re-mains sustainable in the future.<br><br>
We are committed to being upfront and honest about the tough choices we face and the changes that will occur, as they affect our people personally. We will stay engaged and continue to ad-just and improve how we will meet the needs of those who sacrifice to defend the Nation. <br><br>

Earn the trust of our families<br><br>
The force can commit fully to their duties when they know their families are safe and supported in the ways they need most. During the past decade, the philosophy of military family support has been one of “letting a thousand flowers bloom.” Now, with fewer resources, we must optimize how we care for the Military Family and realign our support services to be as agile as the force they serve.<br><br>
We must prioritize and synchro-nize our support to reflect the needs of today’s Military Family, which is as diverse as the Nation it serves. We must ensure we are investing in the right services at the right time while adapt-ing for the future needs of the force.<br><br>

Earn the trust of our fellow citizens<br><br>
The establishment of a professional mil-itary comprised entirely of volun-teers is one of our Nation’s finest achievements. It’s been so effec-tive that it can be taken for grant-ed. We must consider what our military means to the people it protects―our fellow citizens―and how the last 12 years has impact-ed how we relate to each other.<br><br>
On our part, we must actively dispute labels of-ten ap-plied too generally across the force and inform a richer conversa-tion about the char-acter of those who volunteer to serve. Our stories are as diverse as our people. We owe it to the Nation to tell those sto-ries. We also have a duty to the Nation to listen. Our fellow citizens may have different perspectives that we need to hear and understand.<br><br>
The public’s interest in our Military Family, which has been so strong over the last decade, may begin to wane as we conclude our operations in Afghanistan.<br><br>
But the needs of the military families reintegrating into their civilian communi-ties, our Wounded Warriors, and our Gold Star Families will remain for years to come. How we discuss and engage these issues must reinforce the Nation’s trust in military service. Military service is about stability, meaning, and variety, and we must continue to inspire those who will volunteer to serve in the future.<br><br>

Our Nation counts on us to lead our way through the challenges we face. I have been impressed with what the Joint Force has accom-plished in my two years as Chairman, over 12 years of war, and throughout my 39 years of military service. But there is more work to be done, and I need your help to do it. I trust you and I have confidence in you. Our continued commitment and work together will ensure we remain the most respected profession, the global leader, and our Nation’s strength.<br><br>
I’m proud to serve with you,
<br><br>
MARTIN E. DEMPSEY<br><br>
General, U.S. Army<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
 Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz’s 4,000 Page ‘Gray Book’ Collection To Be Put Online<br><br>

The Gray Book was started hours after the Dec. 7, 1941 attack, by Capt. James Steele, a member of Nimitz’s staff. It runs through the major events of the Pacific Theater until Aug. 31, 1945, just two days before Nimitz was present aboard the USS Missouri (BB 63) in Tokyo Bay to sign the instrument of surrender. The physical collection is possessed by the Naval History and Heritage Command’s (NHHC) Operational Archives and consists of 4,030 single-sided pages. The pages fill 28 banker boxes and are held at the Operational Archives at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C.<br><br>


The physical collection is possessed by the Naval History and Heritage Command’s (NHHC) Operational Archives and consists of 4,030 single-sided pages. The pages fill 28 banker boxes and are held at the Operational Archives at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C.<br><br>

The size of the Gray Book reflects the magnitude of the job Nimitz undertook when he replaced Adm. Husband E. Kimmel on Dec. 25, 1941. After three years, he became a Fleet Admiral, a newly created five star rank. “You’re getting the whole picture, from the South Pacific to the Aleutians, and picking up on the progress of the war,” said Robert Cressman, a historian at NHHC.<br><br>

Although the Gray Book was declassified in 1972, it wasn’t made available to the public. The pages of the Gray Book are fragile after decades of storage. It took an immense undertaking, funded by the Naval War College Foundation, with support from the NHHC, to digitize the collection. After Feb. 24, that collection will be available worldwide to authors, researchers, naval history enthusiasts, and sailors interested in their naval heritage. As the U.S. pivots to the Pacific, this collection will offer insights into a previous time when the Pacific was a crucial operational area. “I think it’s immensely valuable for people to see how it was done,” said Cressman. “You’re getting a fly-on-the-wall approach to how decisions were made and how the war was fought.”<br><br>


“They clearly reveal what Nimitz thought was important, which gives the reader a great deal of insight into how his experiences both operationally and at the Naval War College informed and influenced his prosecution of the war.”
<br><br>
Those who have had a chance to view the Gray Book offered a sneak peek. “I’ve seen the collection and it’s really a national treasure,” said Capt. Henry Hendrix, Ph.D., director of the NHHC. “They clearly reveal what Nimitz thought was important, which gives the reader a great deal of insight into how his experiences both operationally and at the Naval War College informed and influenced his prosecution of the war. I’m extremely pleased we can now share it with researchers, the American public, and sailors past and present. I’m eager to see the collection discussed and to demonstrate the continued relevance of leveraging history in the decision making process,” Hendrix added.

　　上个世纪“冷战”后期，苏联研究了一艘新型无声推进系统的战略弹道导弹核潜艇――“红十月”号，艇长拉米斯负责首次试航演习。由于妻子遭遇医疗事故去世，无从申诉且备受打击的拉米斯，决定利用这次演习的机会叛逃到美国。为此，苏联出动了近百艘潜艇前去围堵“红十月”号，美国则动用了全部力量，甚至请英国皇家海军协助搜寻“红十月”号。一场惊心动魄的高科技潜艇大战在大西洋展开。最终，“红十月”号驶入美国维吉尼亚州的诺福克海军基地。<br><br>

　　这不是一场军事行动，而是小说，美国马里兰州当时一位名不见经传的保险商，汤姆・克兰西（Tom Clancy）的处女作《猎杀“红十月”号》。1984年，他以5000美元将这本小说卖给马里兰州的海军学院出版社。编辑黛博拉・格罗夫纳立即为之着迷，并说服出版社：“我断定这一定会是一本畅销书，如果我们不抓住这个机会，别人就会抢去。”<br><br>

　　小说出版后立即成为畅销书，售出4.5万册，甚至惊动了当时的总统里根。在一次晚宴上，里根说，他失眠了，因为《猎杀“红十月”号》让他欲罢不能。里根的评论，让这本小说进入《纽约时报》畅销书榜，最终卖出30万精装本和200万平装本。<br><br>

　　同时，这也成为一种新型的类型小说的开山之作――紧张的间谍情节，夹杂着密集的有关军事、武器、情报机构的专业知识。小说中对军事科学知识的精确描写，甚至得到专业人士的赞赏。1986年的一次采访中，克兰西说：“去年我遇到海军部长约翰・雷曼，他问我的第一个问题是：‘到底是谁把那些弄清楚的？’”<br><br>

　　没有人帮助克兰西弄到那些专业知识和机密情报，小说中所有相关的技术数据和内幕资料，都来自于公开发表的技术手册、军事书籍以及潜艇专家等人的访谈。“我的秘密不过是尽我所能得到许多适合的东西，然后把这些东西编成真的，这才是最惊悚的部分。”<br><br>

　　汤姆・克兰西1947年出生于马里兰州巴尔的摩一个中产阶级家庭。在孩提时代，他不是读儿童文学，而是读海军历史，并立志当一名军官或工程专家。1969年，他从巴尔的摩市罗耀拉学院英语系毕业后，因视力太差而遭军队拒绝，随后在其第一任妻子的祖父创建的保险公司上班，直到成为一位成功的作家。<br><br>

　　在《猎杀“红色十月”号》大获成功后，克兰西又写了《红色风暴兴起》《爱国者游戏》《克里姆林宫的枢机主教》《燃眉追击》《惊天核网》《彩虹六号》《虎牙》等，总销量过10亿册，其中有17本曾名列《纽约时报》销售榜榜首。在20世纪90年代，敢首印200万册的英语世界作家仅有三位：一位是写“哈利・波特系列”的罗琳女士，一位是写法律惊悚小说的约翰・格里森姆，另一位便是以军事惊悚小说闻名的汤姆・克兰西。多年来，克兰西的名字，甚至变成一个无需解释的形容词出现在其他作家笔下，用于指代紧张惊悚的气氛。<br><br>

　　1994年，克兰西的小说《荣誉的债务》出版。在小说中，克兰西描述了恐怖分子驾驶波音747客机自杀性地攻击美国国会山的情节。这与七年后的“9・11”事件惊人相似，以至于美国民间盛传恐怖分子是按照他的小说策划行动的。<br><br>

　　“9・11”事件发生一个星期后，身为保守分子和共和党的忠实支持者，克兰西在电视访谈中指出，美国左翼政治家要为“9・11”事件负部分责任，因为他们“掏空”了美国中央情报局。克兰西的保守和传统，亦体现在他的小说中。早在1986年，便有评论家指出其小说主人公的坚定忠贞与正派。“所有的美国人都是勇气、坚韧、忠诚爱国的化身。他们的官员无一例外都很称职，有时还鼓舞人心。任何阶层的男人都是忠实的丈夫和慈爱的父亲。”<br><br>

　　他的成功不止于出版界。《猎杀“红十月”号》《爱国者游戏》《燃眉追击》和《惊天核网》等多部作品曾被好莱坞搬上银幕，《彩虹六号》《幽灵行动》和《细胞分裂》被开放为网络游戏。2008年3月，克兰西将作品的冠名使用权永久性授给著名游戏开发公司Ubisoft，公司将会围绕“汤姆・克兰西系列”打造一个核心游戏品牌。<br><br>

　　克兰西认为，自己的成功不是轻松取得的。他提醒那些有志于当作家的人：“学习写作和学习玩高尔夫球一样，你要练习，不停地练习，直到学会。许多人认为你身上有神秘的事物，缪斯可能亲吻你的耳朵。但写作不是神灵能启示的――它是一项艰苦卓绝的劳动。”<br><br>

　　2013年10月1日，66岁的汤姆・克兰西在巴尔的摩因病去世。他的最新小说《命令授权》将在12月出版。由他小说改编、克里斯・派恩主演的《杰克・莱恩：秘影一号》，也将于今年圣诞节上映。 <br><br>

汤姆・克兰西（英语：Tom Clancy，全名英语：Thomas Leo Clancy Jr.，1947年4月12日－2013年10月1日）[1][2]是美国一位畅销小说作家，擅长写作以冷战时期为背景的政治、军事科技以及间谍故事等等，其名字已经成为了军事小说的代表。<br><br>

当某些评论家批评汤姆・克兰西的作品一成不变时，相反地，其作品在市场上大为被推荐，而且热卖，书迷们喜爱他作品中纠结的阴谋、对于军事科技认知之准确以及谍报活动的生动描写。<br><br>

汤姆・克兰西是于1990年代中期热卖了20万本作品的两位作家的其中之一（约翰・葛里逊为另外一位）[3]。他在《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜创下单一作品蝉联榜首数周、上榜数十周之久的佳绩。克兰西于1989年出版的《迫切的危机》卖出了1,625,544本精装本，使他成为1980年代畅销小说作家的第一名。[4]多部克兰西的作品被改编成同名电影或者电子游戏。<br><br>

汤姆・克兰西于美国当地时间2013年10月1日马里兰州住家附近的医院辞世，享年66岁。<br><br>

 克兰西的作家生涯始于1982年，即他开始写《猎杀红色十月号》之时。他本身并没有从军的经验，因此是透过精致的取材才能得到情报。于1985年，海军学会出版社以5000美金的稿费购买了该书的版权。[4][5]出版商非常欣赏该书，而出版社编辑德博拉・格罗夫纳更指出“我认为我们这里有一本潜在的畅销书，如果我们不抓紧这次机会，别人就会。”。[4]虽然如此，出版商仍然要求克兰西削减大量的技术细节，并将页数删减了至少100页。[4]克兰西原本认为该书能售出5,000本，但结果却售出了45,000本。[5][10] 出版后，该书获得美国总统罗纳德・里根的赞赏。当里根赞赏此书后，其销量很快就上升，售出了逾300,000本精装书和200万本平装书。[4][5][9]评论家大多称赞这本书极度精确的技术用语，并让克兰西能够和美军一些高级军官会晤。[4]<br><br>

随着处女作成为畅销书，克兰西又写了好几本军事小说，其中包括1986年的赤色风暴、1987年的爱国者游戏等。这些书都成为了畅销书，而部份更被改编成电影和电子游戏。克兰西本人亦被评价为拥有“绵密的取材能力、精密的分析方式、大胆的军事预言及政治风向”。之后，他创作的以原证券交易员的军事历史学家，尔后担任中央情报局分析师、美国副总统及美国总统的杰克・雷恩为主角的系列作品成为其代表作。<br><br>

到了1988年，《猎杀红色十月号》已为克兰西带来130万美元的收入，而之后的三部作品亦带来300万美元收入。[11]于1997，企鹅普特南出版社表示愿意以5000万美元购买他两部作品的版权，而育碧软件旗下的红色风暴娱乐亦表示愿意与克兰西签下为期四年的2500万美元合约。[12]后来，企鹅普特南出版社又表示若克兰西愿意与杰夫・罗宾合作，酬金就能增加2200万。结果，克兰西在该年获得了9700万美元的酬金。<br><br>

	The Hunt for Red October is a 1990 American action thriller film based on Tom Clancy's novel of the same name. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery as Captain Marko Ramius and Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan. The fictional story is set during the Cold War era; involving a rogue Russian naval captain who wishes to defect to the United States, and an American CIA analyst who correctly deduces that circumstance, and must prove his theory to the U.S. Navy to avoid a violent confrontation between the two nations. <br><br>
故事发生在1984年年底的北大西洋，苏联正处于戈尔巴乔夫上台前夕，也是美苏冷战、进行军备竞赛的高潮时期。<br><br>
当年11月，苏联红海军最新型的台风级核潜艇“红色十月”号，由资深潜艇教官马尔科・瑞米尔斯（Marko Ramius）出任艇长，出发前往北大西洋参加潜艇作战演习。该型潜艇排水量高达三万两千吨，是世界上最大的核动力潜水艇，并装备了大量核弹头弹道导弹。<br><br>
经过
美国情报部门通过卫星发现了“红色十月”的踪迹，并指派洛杉矶级攻击核潜艇“达拉斯”号跟随监视。不料“红色十月”上安装了最新式的喷水推进系统，轻易地甩掉了“达拉斯”号。<br><br>
令人匪夷所思的是，瑞米尔斯舰长杀死了自己的政委，并伪造红海军最高司令部命令，让“红色十月”向着美国海岸挺进。他向全体官兵声称，此举是要利用该艇先进的无声喷水推进系统打破美国海军的监视网，并纵情游览美国的海岸线。<br><br>
“达拉斯”无法追踪“红十月”，这使美国十分惊恐，以为这是一场偷袭。在秘密会议上，中情局情报员瑞恩博士（Dr. Ryan）大胆地认为瑞米尔斯有意变节投奔美国。这一判断得到了上司的肯定，并给他三天时间，设法与“红色十月”取得联系。<br><br>
红海军最高司令部收到了瑞米尔斯舰长的变节通告信，大为震怒。红海军在北大西洋的各个舰队倾巢出动，布下天罗地网追杀“红色十月”。而美国方面收到了苏联关于“红色十月”企图擅自向美国发射导弹、挑起世界大战的警告，也对瑞米尔斯舰长的行为感到担忧，为保证安全，开始寻找并准备击沉这条巨大的潜艇。而此刻，“红色十月”又遭到了克格勃潜伏特工的破坏，陷入重重危机。三方在冰冷的北大西洋展开了一场全方面的混乱角逐。<br><br>
瑞恩冒着被冰冷海水冻死的危险，登上美国潜艇“达拉斯”号，识破了借刀杀人的计划，并与“红色十月”取得了联系。瑞恩和瑞米尔斯彼此没有见面，却心有灵犀，不久，瑞恩和“达拉斯”的舰长、水手终于登上了“红色十月”，协助瑞米尔斯舰长，在幽深的海底上演了一场精巧而致命的潜艇战，击沉了追踪而来的苏联潜艇Kanavalov号，并击毙了潜伏在“红色十月”上的特工。<br><br>
结果<br><br>
最终，“红色十月”号在一个平静的月夜驶入了美国的河湾……<br><br>

Sir Walter Raleigh declared in the early 17th century that "whoever commands the sea, commands the trade; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself."<br><br>


	In 1984, Soviet submarine Captain First Rank Marko Ramius (Connery) commands Red October, a new heavy-class nuclear sub featuring a caterpillar drive rendering it undetectable to passive sonar. Ramius leaves port on orders to conduct exercises with the submarine V.K. Konovalov, commanded by his former student Captain Tupolev  . Once at sea, Ramius kills political officer Ivan Putin (Firth), the only man aboard besides himself who knows the sub's orders. He then burns the orders, replaces them with counterfeit ones, and commands the crew to head toward America's east coast to conduct missile drills. The American submarine USS Dallas, on patrol in the North Atlantic, briefly detects Red October but loses contact once Ramius engages the silent drive.<br><br>

The next morning, CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Baldwin) briefs government officials on the departure of Red October and the threat it poses. Officials in the briefing, learning that the bulk of the Soviet Navy has been deployed to sink Red October, fear Ramius may plan an unauthorized strike against the United States. Ryan, however, hypothesizes that Ramius instead plans to defect, and leaves for the North Atlantic to prove his theory before the U.S. Navy is ordered to sink Red October. Meanwhile, Tupolev, though unable to track the Red October, guesses his former mentor's route and sets a new course across the Atlantic.<br><br>

Red October's caterpillar drive fails during a deep sea maneuver. No longer silent, the submarine comes under attack by Soviet forces and begins risky maneuvers through undersea canyons. Petty Officer Jones (Vance), a sonar technician aboard Dallas who has discovered a way to detect Red October, plots an intercept course. Ryan arranges a hazardous mid-ocean rendezvous to get aboard Dallas, where he attempts to persuade its captain, Commander Bart Mancuso (Glenn), to contact Ramius and determine his intentions.<br><br>

A Soviet Ambassador informs the U.S. that the sub is a renegade and asks for their help to sink it. An order to do this is communicated to the U.S. Fleet, including Dallas. However, Ryan is convinced Ramius plans to defect and convinces Mancuso to make contact with Ramius and offer assistance. Ramius, stunned that the Americans correctly guessed his plan, accepts their cooperation. He then stages a nuclear reactor emergency and orders the bulk of his crew to abandon ship, telling the doctor Petrov (Curry) that he and the other officers will scuttle the sub rather than let it be captured. After Ramius submerges Red October, Ryan, Mancuso, and Jones come aboard via a rescue sub, at which point Ramius formally requests asylum in the United States for himself and his officers.<br><br>

Thinking their mission is complete, Red October's skeleton crew are surprised by a torpedo attack from the Konovalov, which has followed them across the Atlantic. As the two Soviet subs maneuver, one of Red October's cooks, Loginov (Arana), an undercover GRU agent who has hidden himself on board, opens fire, fatally wounding Ramius's first officer, Vasily Borodin (Neill) before retreating into the missile launch area, followed by Ramius and Ryan. Loginov shoots Ramius, wounding him, but Ryan shoots Loginov before he can detonate a missile and destroy the sub.<br><br>

Meanwhile, with help from Dallas, Red October makes evasive maneuvers, causing Konovalov to be destroyed by one of its own torpedoes. The evacuated crew of Red October, about to be taken on board a U.S. Navy rescue ship, witness this explosion and, not knowing that there is a second Soviet sub, assume it was Red October that was sunk. Their subterfuge complete, Ryan and Ramius sail Red October to the Penobscot River in Maine.<br><br>

“中国不能没有核潜艇”<br><br>
 

作者：南方周末记者 于冬 南方周末特约撰稿 米晋国 王庆厚  
2013-11-07<br><br>

作为解放军序列中最为神秘的部队，中国核潜艇部队已成军42年，近日，它卸下神秘面纱，引得各方揣测：中国军方为何在近期选择“亮剑”，是有意展现军事透明和自信，还是发出威慑信号？<br><br>

“此举是为了向日本宣示武力。”英国广播公司直言不讳。中国海军少将尹卓也认为这是一种信号，“谁要对我有不利的行为，我们有核潜艇用来对付它”。日本近来频繁地扩充军备，在钓鱼岛一再冲击中方“红线”。这时，中国海军揭秘海上“杀手锏”――核潜艇，被认为可以达到“不战而屈人之兵”的效果。<br><br>
“使用一代，研究一代，摸索一代。”在军事专家杜文龙眼里，依照解放军武器装备更新换代的规律，中国选择揭秘核潜艇部队也表明，新型核潜艇研究与探索取得相当进步。<br><br>

一个国家的核力量通常依赖三种发射平台：以发射井、重型载重汽车、铁路列车为载体的陆基核力量，以远程轰炸机为主的空基核力量，以核潜艇为基础的海基核力量。如今，陆上的导弹发射基地和导弹机动车队都难以逃避天空中的眼睛――侦察卫星和各类电子侦察机。由核潜艇打造的海基核力量，前景最被看好。<br><br>
“我们早就习惯了只做不说。”一位潜艇部队军官告诉南方周末记者，“中国不能没有核潜艇。”<br><br>

一声不响地隐匿于黑暗的深海，一艘战略导弹核潜艇就是一座浮动、隐蔽的导弹基地。在充满未知的深海独自执行任务，核潜艇的动力还要依靠“暴躁”的核反应堆，官兵们随时都要面对生死的考验。<br><br>

核潜艇每一次出海都像打仗，危险无处不在，险阻如影随形。每次出海前，许多海军官兵都会悄悄地写好“遗书”。<br><br>
空气、水、阳光是生命中必不可少也是最廉价的三要素。这三样也是核潜艇官兵出航时最昂贵的“奢侈品”。喝水是定量的，洗脸是奢望的。长时间水下生活，艇员们的体质明显下降，许多人出现失眠、头晕、食欲不振、记忆力减退、血压降低、腰腿疼痛、大腿根部溃疡等。原来全艇人员一顿能吃几十斤米，在水下连一半都吃不了。<br><br>

中国核潜艇部队生于“忧患”。1958年6月，核潜艇工程从西方玩具店里买来的核潜艇模型开始起步。核潜艇工程也被列为最高机密，取名“09工程”――“09”是当时中国城市火警的报警电话号码。此番命名表明，研制核潜艇十万火急、刻不容缓。<br><br>

当时，中国在“两极”格局的夹缝中谋求生存。1954年，美军第一艘核潜艇“鹦鹉螺”号下水，它穿越过北极的冰层，而消耗的核燃料却只有几公斤。中苏关系逐渐恶化，1959年9月，赫鲁晓夫来华时说：“核潜艇的技术复杂，你们搞不了，花钱太多，你们不要搞。”<br><br>
“核潜艇，一万年也要搞出来！”毛泽东简单一句话道出了中国人的意志。1970年12月26日，中国第一艘攻击型核潜艇正式下水，中国的海上威慑力也随之而生。<br><br>

日历一张张翻过，昼夜一次次轮回。<br><br>

防微杜渐才能保证核安全，“必须百分之二百地确保核安全”已经成为了海军潜艇部队的座右铭。自第一艘核潜艇“长征一号”下水服役，中国核潜艇已安全航行42年，是当今世界上唯一未发生核潜艇事故的国家。<br><br>

中国依然面临着严峻的海上威胁，核潜艇部队独特作用也在凸显。与其说它可能会改变全球性战争的进程，不如说它对国际政治斗争正在不断地产生影响。<br><br>

核潜艇亮相马航客机搜寻阵容<br><br>

据英国媒体报道，英国国防部1日宣布，英国皇家海军派出“特拉法尔加”级“不懈”号核潜艇，协助搜寻马航失联客机。5日，“不懈”号核潜艇再次下水进行探测。中国军事专家李杰在采访时表示，英国在这个时刻派出核潜艇，是希望能出个奇兵，派出不同于之前的卫星、反潜机、水面舰艇的独特装备以期提高发现黑匣子的概率。<br><br>

　　美国媒体报道，英国派遣核潜艇参与马航MH370客机搜寻工作，尽管美国尚未进行类似表态，但分析人士称美军潜艇或已开始搜寻工作。<br><br>

　　其实，核潜艇参与民航失事客机搜索并不鲜见，2009年法国搜寻法航447航班时就派出“红宝石”级核潜艇“绿宝石”号参加搜索行动。
<br><br>
　　核潜艇靠什么搜索<br><br>

　　核潜艇的声纳，从原理上分，有艇艏主动声纳和被动声纳两种。如果进行水下搜索，则主要使用主动声纳。那么，我们通常认为用于主动攻击的主动声纳，如何搜索客机残骸？实际上，核潜艇同样可以通过主动声纳的声音回波，搜索和导航。早在1970年代，美国和前苏联海军就使用核动力潜艇，通过主动声纳对北极地区水下地形进行了测绘。
<br><br>
　　核潜艇一般装备了完善的声纳系统，其对搜索黑匣子有很大的帮助。以此次参与搜索的英国“不懈”号核潜艇为例，该核潜艇配备了2076型主/被动艇艏声纳、2007型舷侧阵声纳、2019型探雷避障声纳和2020型拖曳线列阵声纳。
<br><br>
　　潜艇适合进行对黑匣子搜索，是因为潜艇的声纳系统比水面军舰更加完善。除了与水面军舰相同的各类搜索、攻击声纳外，潜艇还装备了侦察声纳、探雷声纳。侦察声纳是被动声纳，接收频段很宽，用于侦测敌方潜艇、声自导鱼雷的主动声纳信号，对于信号特征已知的黑匣子声信号探测就更简单了。<br><br>

　　相比常规潜艇，核潜艇动力系统工作时不需要氧气，可以长时间在水下执行任务，效率要更好。
<br><br>
　　核潜艇搜索的优劣
<br><br>
　　目前，对MH370客机水下搜索主要使用的是无人潜水器和拖拽式黑匣子探知仪。那么，昂贵且出动成本极高的核潜艇和这两样比，优势有多大呢？<br><br>

　　航速快、水下逗留时间长是核潜艇寻找黑匣子的优势。“不懈”号核潜艇水下最大航速达32公里。为了保证搜索效果，核潜艇可能会采用12节左右的安静航速并使用被动声纳搜索黑匣子发出的脉冲信号。据报道，参与搜索行动的美国等国测量船配备了TPL-25型拖曳式黑匣子定位仪，其工作时的拖曳速度在1-3节，每天能搜索150平方英里的面积，通过换算，速度更快的核潜艇每天搜索面积是海上测量船的4倍以上。<br><br>

　　“不懈”号是一艘攻击型核潜艇，由于采用了核动力，其正常水下逗留时间可达70天左右，可在海底进行不间断搜索。和水面搜索舰艇容易遭受恶劣天气、海况等因素影响搜索行动相比，核潜艇在水下航行可以说基本上不用考虑恶劣天气、海况的影响。潜艇可利用携带的机器人对飞机残骸进行回收，并为更大规模的搜救提供线索。
<br><br>
　　值得一提的是，核潜艇对黑匣子信号的搜索效率不一定比水面舰船的拖曳式黑匣子搜索仪高。因为现在划定的搜索海域水深超过3000米，英军核潜艇的最大潜深只有300米，而拖曳式黑匣子搜索仪最大工作水深可达6000米。
<br><br>
　　网友呼吁中国出动核潜艇
<br><br>
　　自马航MH370客机失联以来，一直有不少网友呼吁中国海军出动核潜艇参与搜索。但理想终归是理想，现实情况是我国与美英澳等国在军事上没有完全建立信任。尽管此次人道主义搜救，各国显示出了高度合作，但核潜艇作为大国重器还是必须保证其机密性。
<br><br>
　　英军的情况不同，英国与我国没有潜在的军事对抗可能，他们此次派出的“不懈”号攻击核潜艇属“特拉法尔加”级的第3艘，1985年服役，已使用了接近30年，按计划明年退役、由机敏级的三号艇接替。
<br><br>
　　美军拥有先进的核潜艇，澳军也有先进的常规潜艇。他们一直没有出动，而是协调远处的英军核潜艇前来搜索，说明美澳两国也在注意避免己方潜艇机密被正在搜索海域的外国军舰获得。
<br><br>
　　与潜艇类似，海军或海洋调查部门的专业水声测量船、潜艇救援船也有很完善、甚至功能更强大的声纳设备，可以用于搜索黑匣子。所以此次英国海军、澳大利亚海军也都投入了水声测量船。我国此前在泰国湾也派遣了永兴岛号潜艇救援船。
<br><br>
　　我国“海巡01”船、“南海救115”船和“东海救101”船目前正在利用黑匣子搜索仪进行搜寻作业。5日，中国“海巡01”侦听到疑似马航失联客机的黑匣子信号，引起极大的关注。

 中国核潜艇部队42年来首次揭秘 打击力趋于成熟<br><br>
2013年10月28日  中国新闻网<br><br>
国海军第一支核潜艇部队――海军北海舰队某潜艇基地组建以来，创造了世界核潜艇一次长航时间新纪录；检验了中国核潜艇深海作战性能；水下发射运载火箭，宣告中国海基战略威慑力量正式形成；连续42年守护核安全，从未发生过核事故。 此次这支“杀手锏”部队首次揭秘。
　中新网10月28日电(姚培硕)上世纪70年代，一支代号为09的特殊部队诞生了――中国核潜艇部队。作为一支崭新的部队，中国核潜艇部队从零起步，在一片荆棘中艰难探索前行。42年过去了，这支神秘的部队是如何履行历史使命的？又经历了哪些不为人知的考验呢？对此，中央媒体进行了大规模的、浓墨重彩的报道。有分析指出，中国核潜艇打击力量已经趋于成熟。<br><br>

核潜艇部队42年首揭秘 曾遇外军反潜机侦察
<br><br>
　　中国海军核潜艇部队组建42年来从未出现过重大事故。从首次水下发射运载火箭成功，到打破世界核潜艇出航时间最长纪录；从与外军反潜机的遭遇战，到舰艇官兵出征前写好的遗书。这是此支“杀手锏”部队的首次揭秘。<br><br>

　　目前，世界上只有6个国家拥有战略导弹核潜艇。中国自行研制的第一艘核潜艇1970年12月下水，1974年8月正式服役。在此后的40余年中，中国核潜艇部队经历了从无到有、从弱到强的蜕变。1983年，中国第一艘09II型导弹核潜艇编入海军序列。
<br><br>
　　核潜艇是国家的战略利器，也是国家安全的重要保证。1985年11月，中国核潜艇开始首次最大自给力考核试验。据了解，决定核潜艇续航时间长短的因素，主要是人员的耐受性和设备的可靠性。“怕死不干核潜艇”，潜艇官兵凭借着强大的信念，克服孤独、失眠等困难，以90昼夜、数万海里，创造新的长航纪录。<br><br>

　　极限深潜是核潜艇必须要闯过的一道生死关。在世界核潜艇历史上，曾导致灾难性惨剧。1988年4月，海军某核潜艇奉命执行极限深潜任务。在接近极限深度时，艇体受海水挤压，艇内的支撑角钢出现弯曲，几处出现轻微渗水现象。但凭借着过硬的技术力量和设备，此次大深度极限深潜，创造了中国核潜艇发展史上的新纪录，同时检验了深海作战性能。
<br><br>
　　1988年9月，中国海军核潜艇成功完成水下发射运载火箭任务，标志着中国海基战略防御力量初步形成。美国《海军学会会报》写道：“当中国宣布她从潜艇上发射弹道导弹试验成功时，事情已经变得很清楚：中华人民共和国即将成为世界上第五个拥有海基核威慑力量的核大国。” 作为解放军的战略铁拳，初步具备了核威慑和核反击能力。
<br><br>
　　鱼雷是潜艇的主要作战武器，也是作战能力的重要体现。在训练过程中，官兵们进行延长鱼雷在艇上储存突破性尝试，成功实施了水下多雷齐射。核潜艇每一次练兵都像打仗。“你可以没有我，可中国不能没有核潜艇”。每次出海前，许多人都会悄悄地写好“遗书”。
<br><br>
　　在一次执行战备训练任务中，突遇疑似外军反潜飞机侦查。一级军士长穆美田回忆称，雷达显示屏一个微弱信号一闪而过后顷刻消失。在艇长下令紧急下潜后8分钟，一架外军反潜机果然掠海而过，却一无所获。这一次细至毫巅的捕捉，创下了核潜艇侦测雷达空情预警时间最长、信息最准确的纪录。

　　中央媒体解密浓墨重彩 核潜艇打击力趋于成熟
<br><br>
　　10月28日，《人民日报》，《解放军报》，《人民日报海外版》，《光明日报》，《中国青年报》等媒体头版刊文解密中国海军第一支战略核潜艇部队。在27日晚间，央视新闻联播也在头条用4分钟篇幅报道了海军杀手锏――中国核潜艇部队。首次曝光核潜艇部队大量的视频和训练细节，并配发短评《让祖国说话更有分量》。
<br><br>
　　此外，中央电视台在报道解放军机动5号演习时也提及了在远海进行了潜艇伏击和反潜演练。有分析指出，潜艇参与远海演习和央媒披露核潜艇部队，两者并非巧合。说明中国核潜艇打击力量已经趋于成熟。
<br><br>
　　28日，《人民日报》在头版头条刊文《深海大洋锻利剑》指出，这是一支“静悄悄”的神秘部队：藏身在万顷碧波，虽然时时惊心动魄，但每次出征都悄无声息；潜伏于浩瀚海天，尽管次次表现出色，但凯旋时却默默无闻。
<br><br>
　　《解放军报》亦在头版刊文《铸就共和国水下核盾》，揭秘执掌“大国重器”的神秘部队――中国海军某潜艇基地。该基地司令员高峰称，40余年来，一代代官兵驾驭核潜艇纵横大洋，建功深蓝，创造了数十项载入历史的纪录：水下长航90昼夜，打破世界核潜艇一次出航时间最长纪录；大深度极限深潜，检验了我国核潜艇深海作战性能；水下发射运载火箭，宣告中国海基战略威慑力量正式形成；连续40余年守护核安全，从未发生过核事故！
<br><br>
　　当日，《人民日报海外版》、《光明日报》、《中国青年报》也分别在头版以《铸就海下核盾牌》、《骑鲸蹈海铸核盾》、《大国利剑 海上长城》为题对中国首支核潜艇部队进行报道。有媒体分析称，此次中央媒体大规模披露，是更多的展现人民海军的装备成果，也展示出中国海军的海基二次核反击能力的有效性，对于提升中国海上安全和国家安全是有必要的。
<br><br>
　　另有媒体分析，从短期来说，在中日关系紧张之际，中国披露已组建42年的海军战略核潜艇部队，剑有所指。而从长期来说，这是对中国“强军梦”决心的重大宣示，再结合近期中国海军三大舰队的十余条舰船首次会师西太平洋演习，中国新海军战略呼之欲出。
<br><br>
人民日报北京10月27日电　  这是一支“静悄悄”的神秘部队：藏身在万顷碧波，虽然时时惊心动魄，但每次出征都悄无声息；潜伏于浩瀚海天，尽管次次表现出色，但凯旋时却默默无闻。
<br><br>
　　这是一支“撒手锏”的战略部队：让祖国骄傲、令对手胆寒；象征大国地位、支撑国家安全；牢记强军目标、献身强军实践；驰骋大洋深处、点燃深海雷霆。
<br><br>
　　这就是中国海军第一支核潜艇部队――海军北海舰队某潜艇基地。多年来，基地官兵用忠诚和汗水创造出中国潜艇史上多个“首次”和“第一”：90昼夜长航，创造世界核潜艇一次长航时间新纪录；大深度极限深潜，检验了我国核潜艇深海作战性能；水下发射运载火箭，宣告中国海基战略威慑力量正式形成；作为我军战略铁拳，初步具备了核威慑和核反击能力；连续42年守护核安全，从未发生核事故……
<br><br>
　　42年来，他们听党指挥，将如磐信念镌刻在波谷浪尖。潜艇远航执行的是独立作战任务，绝对忠诚、绝对纯洁、绝对可靠是首要政治要求，基地把政治战略和外交考量融汇进每一个决策每一次行动，官兵驾驭核潜艇安全航行百万海里，圆满完成一系列重大试验和战训任务，始终做到“艇由我操纵，我听党指挥”，涌现出被中央军委授予“水下先锋艇”的第11艇员队等一批先进典型。
<br><br>
　　42年来，他们能打胜仗，在深海大洋锻造利剑。面对世界新军事变革浪潮，面对打赢信息化条件下海上局部战争的历史性课题，基地把一切工作向打赢聚焦，率领官兵精练技能、巧练战法、历练谋略。近几年来，他们投入巨资加大信息化训练设施的升级改造，建成功能齐全的信息化训练中心。仅过去5年，他们就填补了某型核潜艇10余项战术训练空白。经历几代人的努力，训练的难度、强度和出海频率逐年上升，基地官兵在一次次闯关历险中创造了20多项首次和第一。
<br><br>
　　42年来，他们英勇顽强，永远保持舍我其谁的冲锋姿态。基地官兵针对核潜艇部队的特殊风险和考验，着力磨练迎难而上、敢打必胜的顽强意志和战斗作风。基地组建以来，官兵们驭鲸蹈海，多次在深海大洋与对手强敌交手过招。最大自给力考核实验，装备性能和艇员生理心理都达到了极限值。他们发扬科学求实、敢为人先的精神，先后攻克了12项关键性技术，使得我国成为世界上具备成功实施核潜艇安全退役的少数几个国家之一。
<br><br>
　　42年来，他们舍生忘死，用无悔青春书写壮丽的人生乐章。基地官兵勇于叫响“怕死不干核潜艇”的口号，为核潜艇事业甘愿透支生命，甚至献出生命。以孟昭旭烈士为代表的机电官兵群体，在故障险情面前勇于“堵枪眼”。一代代艇员把职业情结融入血脉，面对职业风险义无反顾，“父子兵”、“兄弟兵”在这里前仆后继、接力奋斗。与此同时，他们的亲人也充分理解和积极支持，留下了一段段佳话、一个个故事。<br><br>

沃尔特 雷利爵士（Sir Walter Raleigh，1552年－1618年10月29日），英国伊丽莎白时代著名的冒险家。<br><br>

雷利出生于德文（Devon）的新教徒家庭，他早年在牛津大学奥里尔学院（Oriel College）读书，之后有大半时间待在爱尔兰、基鲁拉堡、克罗美隆、西米斯郡，参与了镇压爱尔兰人的起义与斯摩维克（Smerwick）及雷斯林岛（Rathlin Island）上最著名的奢杀后，因坦率地批评了英国对爱尔兰的政策而引起伊丽莎白一世的注意，他得到了女王的召见，在对外和海洋贸易政策上提出自己的观点，得到了女王的大力支持，并于1585年受爵。<br><br>

其中在他与女王讲述过去于新大陆的冒险历程以及观察西班牙如何在海外殖民贸易上撷取庞大财富的报告里，最重要的一段话可以算是现今海权论形成的雏型：<br><br>

“谁控制了海洋，谁就控制了贸易；谁控制了世界贸易，谁就控制了世界的财富，最后也就控制了世界本身。”<br><br>

这句话据说进而导致了伊丽莎白女王开始着重于英国海军舰队的培育、海外殖民的野心以及海盗夺取西班牙载宝船的国家特许化(私掠许可)。<br><br>

他年轻时致力于早期英国在新大陆的殖民地开拓，并在1584年于北美洲建立维吉尼亚(Virginia)(约现今美国的北卡罗莱纳州与维吉尼亚州部分)以歌颂当时的英国女王伊丽莎白一世(历史著名的童贞女王，而维吉尼亚有处女(Virgin)地之意)。在此之后他获得了女王的召见，并向其展示从大西洋对岸初次带回来的马铃薯与烟草等美洲作物，顿时令皇家宫廷陷于吞云吐雾的畅快当中，女王相当满意这位年轻又带有才气的冒险家，于隔年1585年受予他爵士之位。<br><br>

而在1591年他未经女王的允许下，与女王的侍女伊丽莎白 思罗克莫顿秘密结婚，使伊丽莎白十分恼怒，便以玷污宫女的贞操和荣誉之名，将雷利投进了伦敦塔。之后在女王的宽恕下获释，夫妻转到多塞特的Sherborne定居。<br><br>

然冒险家的因子让他不甘久居一地。当他听到有关黄金之城---埃尔多拉多(El Dorado)的传说后，他便于1595年率领一支探险队前往南美洲寻找黄金。雷利首先在特立尼达登陆，并声称该岛为英国所有。然后，他航行到委内瑞拉的奥利诺科河河口。他溯河而上，历时15天，然后转回并考察了圭亚那和苏里南的海岸地带。但这次探险是失败的，没有补给，没有黄金，没有收获。1603年伊丽莎白女王逝世后，随即被继任的詹姆斯一世以涉及意图颠覆王位的主要阴谋(Main Plot)罪名下狱。<br><br>

1616年雷利给国王写信，说服他忘掉过去，派他去二十年前去过的圭亚那远征。詹姆斯一世同意后，雷利获假释，保证在不侵犯西班牙利益的前提下在那里开发金矿。但是结果一无所获，且其下属烧毁了一处西班牙居民点。于是，詹姆斯根据1603年原判，于1618年在白厅(Whitehall)将他处死。<br><br>

Sir Walter Raleigh declared in the early 17th century that "whoever commands the sea, commands the trade; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself."<br><br>


Sir Walter Raleigh, English adventurer, writer, and favorite courtier of Queen Elizabeth I, is beheaded in London, under a sentence brought against him 15 years earlier for conspiracy against King James I.<br><br>

During Elizabeth's reign, Raleigh organized three major expeditions to America, including the first English settlement in America, in 1587―the ill-fated Roanoke settlement located in present-day North Carolina. Raleigh later fell out of favor with Elizabeth after she learned of his secret marriage to Bessy Throckmorton, one of her maids-of-honor, and he was imprisoned with his wife in the Tower of London. After buying his freedom, Raleigh married Bessy and distanced himself from the jealous English queen.<br><br>

After Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was implicated as a foe of King James I and imprisoned with a death sentence. The death sentence was later commuted, and in 1616 Raleigh was freed to lead an expedition to the New World, this time to establish a gold mine in the Orinoco River region of South America. However, the expedition was a failure, and when Raleigh returned to England the death sentence of 1603 was invoked against him.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T17">“中国原子弹之父”考</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
黄庆桥 车玉晓 《 中华读书报 》（ 2013年12月11日   12 版）<br><br>
    自中国第一颗原子弹成功爆炸，就出现了“中国原子弹之父”的说法，但自始至今，关于谁是“中国原子弹之父”，却一直争论不休。在中国第一颗原子弹成功爆炸50周年即将到来之际，梳理一下“中国原子弹之父”说法的传播与流变似乎是有意义的。<br><br>

    “中国原子弹之父”是一舶来品，于1965年由法国传入中国。1965年7月，钱三强收到法国友人巴杭德邮寄的法国《科学与生活》杂志上题为《在中国科学的后面是什么》的文章。文中写道:“中国的科学研究工作是由中国科学院领导的。北京原子能研究所的领导人是曾在巴黎大学索邦学习过的物理学家钱三强博士。他才真正是中国原子弹之父。”这是目前所见关于“中国原子弹之父”的最早版本。需要指出的是，在当时，即便是私人信件，只要是从外国寄来的，也要由组织上收拆。上述巴杭德的来信，就由原子能所首先拆看，后报“科委八局”，再转二机部七局，最后批转给钱三强的秘书。这么一圈下来，我们可以确定，“中国原子弹之父”说从1965年已被国人知晓并在国内传播。<br><br>

    “文革”结束以后，在思想日益活跃的时代背景下，人们对“谁是中国原子弹之父”有着不同的看法，形成了至少四种观点。<br><br>

    第一种观点认为钱三强是中国原子弹之父。“文革”之后，“钱三强是中国原子弹之父”的说法广为传播。<br><br>

    在“文革”后兴起的报告文学热中，钱三强成为重点宣传对象。1978年9月26日，《文汇报》发表《热风吹雨洒江天――访核物理学家钱三强》一文，公开提到中国原子弹之父。1979年，北京出版社和中国科学院党委合作出版的《科学的春天》一书中，收录了作家张炯采写的《向光明的中国前进――记钱三强》一文。1987年10月27日，《科学报》发表《播春者之歌――记著名核物理学家钱三强的奉献》一文。1990年1月，王春江著《裂变之光――记钱三强》一书出版，随后，《文汇报》、《北京晚报》分别连载，影响甚大。这些带有传记性质的报告文学作品无疑加强了人们对于“钱三强是中国原子弹之父”这一观点的认可和接受。<br><br>

    另外，以《人民日报》为代表的官方媒体旗帜鲜明地提出和论证了“钱三强是中国原子弹之父”。1999年8月30日，《人民日报》发表《钱三强:“中国原子弹之父”》一文，这是中国最权威的官方媒体首次正面回应有关“中国原子弹之父”的问题。同年9月，由中宣部宣传教育局编写的《人民不会忘记――共和国的建设者》一书出版，其中就有《中国原子弹之父钱三强》一文。此后，《人民日报(海外版)》于2007年和2009年两次沿用了“钱三强是中国原子弹之父”的说法。<br><br>

    第二种观点认为邓稼先是“中国原子弹之父”。此说亦影响甚大。作为杰出的核物理学家，邓稼先隐姓埋名为中国“两弹”事业的发展作出了重大贡献。1986年，在邓稼先生命的最后岁月，他的事迹经过官方媒体的广泛宣传开始为人所知。1986年6月，中央军委主席邓小平亲自签署命令，任命邓稼先为国防科工委科技委副主任。1986年7月29日，邓稼先病逝。<br><br>

    由于国内媒体大量的宣传报道，尤其是邓小平等党和国家领导人对邓稼先的充分肯定，有关邓稼先是“中国原子弹之父”的说法于1980年代末开始传播。美籍华裔著名物理学家杨振宁在此说的传播中发挥了重要作用。1993年8月21日，在邓稼先去世7周年之际，杨振宁撰写的《邓稼先》一文于《人民日报》发表。该文将邓稼先与被誉为美国“原子弹之父”的奥本海默相提并论，虽然文中没有出现“原子弹之父”的字句，但明眼人一看就知道杨振宁是将自己的好友看作“中国原子弹之父”。因为杨振宁的名气，也因为《人民日报》的特殊地位，该文的影响很大，广为人们征引。<br><br>

    第三种观点认为聂荣臻是中国的“原子弹之父”。这种观点最早见于1989年由河南人民出版社出版的英国人克莱尔 霍林沃思所著《毛泽东和他的分歧者》一书，该书并未对此观点进行深入说明和阐述。1999年王君编著的《我们的共和国丛书 九天揽月 建设卷》沿袭了此说。书中写到:“在我国核武器研制工作中，聂荣臻元帅虽然不像那些专家一样去攻克一个个具体的科学难题，但可以这样说，我国整个国防科技事业中一个最大的难题，却是他攻克的。……聂帅对我国的国防科技事业，作出了巨大的、不可磨灭的贡献。他不愧为我国的‘原子弹之父’。”此说虽有新意，但却与人们心目中的“中国原子弹之父”差异很大，因而影响有限。<br><br>

    第四种观点认为“中国原子弹之父”是一个群体。此说于1980年代中期产生，影响也比较大。1987年，报告文学《中国原子弹之父》一书出版，该书认为:“他们是那样浩大的一个阵容，即使是七十个故事也难尽述!但是，如果把他们的英名镌刻在共和国核工业发展的史册上，那只需要七个字便可概括――中国原子弹之父。”<br><br>

    此说在新的世纪里被张开善先生发扬光大。2006年，张开善在《中共党史资料》上发表《究竟谁是中国原子弹之父――记参与中国第一颗原子弹研制的功勋科学家》一文，该文细数王淦昌、邓稼先、钱三强、郭永怀、朱光亚、陈能宽、周光召、程开甲、彭桓武等科学家的贡献，认为:“中国原子弹之父，不是某一位科学家，而是一个卓越科学家群体。”<br><br>

    应当说，中国原子弹的成功研制，确实是科学家集体协作攻关的胜利。因此，张先生的这一观点是比较容易被人接受的。但这一观点却从学理上有悖于“之父”说的本意，“之父”说本来就是在强调集体之外的个人的特殊贡献，是与集体相对的概念。另外，张先生在此文中认为钱三强“从事核工业发展的高层组织管理工作，无暇参加到中国第一颗原子弹研制的技术攻关当中”，“未能主持、参与中国第一颗原子弹的研制，从而与中国原子弹之父的荣誉失之交臂”。笔者认为，这种观点明显有违历史事实，值得商榷。<br><br>

    第五种观点认为不存在“中国原子弹之父”。2011年，陶纯、陈怀国著《国家命运――中国“两弹一星”的秘密历程》一书出版，由该书改编而成的同名电视剧于2012年下半年在中央电视台播出，影响甚大。在该书结尾，著者谈到了对于“中国原子弹之父”的看法:“当代科学的发展早已不是爱迪生时代，原子弹、氢弹的研制是一项十分宏大的系统工程，中国没有原子弹之父、氢弹之父，中国的核事业是集体的事业，辉煌和光荣不属于哪一个人，却属于每一个人。”这一观点与第四种观一样，都强调中国原子弹工程是集体力量的结晶，但与第四种观点截然相反，认为中国没有原子弹之父。基于同样的理由，得出完全不同的结论，表现出在对“中国原子弹之父”的研究上，观点日益多元。<br><br>

    有关“中国原子弹之父”的讨论还会持续，关键在于，我们必须深入挖掘那个庞大的科学家群体在那个只讲奉献的年代，他们每个人到底在中国原子弹的研制中作出了怎样的贡献;更进一步，数十万人参与了中国的原子弹工程，那些默默无闻者，甚至为此献出宝贵生命的人们，同样值得我们去挖掘和探究!或许这就是讨论“中国原子弹之父”这一话题的意义所在。<br><br>

究竟谁才是中国的原子弹之父<br><br>

张开善 2013年01月14日  人民网<br><br>
 

1964年10月16日下午3时，我国在新疆罗布泊爆炸了第一颗原子弹。在为中国首次核试验做出贡献的科学家当中，究竟谁是中国的原子弹之父?<br><br>

朱光亚是中国第一颗原子弹科学技术计划的组织者和领导者。他亲自主持起草《原子弹装置的科研、设计、制造与试验计划纲要及必须解决的关键问题》，提出关键性的部署，对当时中国原子弹的研制起到了重要的指导作用。<br><br>

彭恒武是造诣颇深的理论物理学家，在中国第一颗原子弹的理论研究中起了重要作用。<br><br>

王淦昌是中国原子弹实验物理工作的开拓者和指挥者，他领导的研究小组发现了世界上第一个荷电负超子――反西格马负超子。<br><br>

郭永怀是举世闻名的空气动力学专家，他指导并组织进行了空气动力学、核武器环境试验等一系列课题的研究，解决了许多重大问题，保证了核武器最后试验的成功。<br><br>

程开甲是核爆炸试验测试的卓越领导者，他带领新疆核试验基地研究所记录下了中国第一颗原子弹爆炸试验97％的数据。<br><br>

邓稼先是中国第一颗原子弹理论设计攻关的组织领导者，对原子弹中的流体力学、状态方程、中子运输等主要理论取得了可喜的研究成果。<br><br>

陈能宽是中国第一颗原子弹研制实验研究领域的主要组织领导者。<br><br>

周光召是我国第一颗原子弹理论研究的奠基者之一，攻克了原子弹理论设计等诸多领域中的重要课题。<br><br>

因此，中国的原子弹之父，不是某一个科学家，而是一个卓越的科学家群体。<br><br>

本・拉登被杀死之后，奥巴马在讲话中，着重强调了他如何指挥了这次行动。他感谢军事人员、情报人员的努力和勇敢。对最关心抓本・拉登的布什，他只提到了一句，说同意布什总统的说法，认为本・拉登不代表伊斯兰。奥巴马只是提前打电话告诉了布什和克林顿，说拉登死了，在公开电视讲话之中，丝毫没有对布什有丝毫的归功，如此片面，即便是在好表现、个人主义盛行的美国，也是引起了一些不满。
<br><br>

 但拉登被杀后，小布什旋即发表声明，祝贺奥巴马杀死了拉登，并和奥巴马一样恭贺军事和情报人员，感谢他们对于行动的贡献：“今天晚上早些时间，奥巴马总统向我致电，告诉我美军已经杀死了本・拉登――发动了9・11的“基地”组织领袖。我向他表示祝贺，也祝贺我国军事和情报团体。这些团体的成员恪尽职守，愿为使命奉献自己的生命。我们将永远地感激他们。对美国、对于全世界追求和平的人、对9・11事件中丧失了亲人的人们来说，这是一个非凡成就，巨大胜利。反恐的斗争还将继续，但是今天晚上，美国向世人发出了不容误读的信息：不管花多少时间，正义必得伸张。”<br><br>


这条简短的声明感动了很多美国人，很多人说布什很有风度。这一点我在看小布什自传的时候就深有感触。布什任内，我和很多人一样对他很有看法。但路遥知马力，日久见人心。小布什是真的道德总统还是伪君子，时间是最好的试金石。他下台后，即便是在推销新书期间，也很少制造话题，攻击现任。奥巴马上台后不久，一度面临很多问题，焦头烂额，民望直下，那时候很多人希望布什站出来说话，向曾经在竞选中非议自己的奥巴马出口恶气，但是布什只是说“他配得我的沉默”（He deserves my silence) 。然后继续在他的德克萨斯老家过深居简出的日子。<br><br>

 

上面的简短声明中，只字未提他个人的任何功劳。而奥巴马本人也丝毫没有认可布什的分寸功劳，似乎一切都是因为他的部署有方所致。这一点很出乎人们意料，让人转而怀疑奥巴马是为了再次当选，给自己在攒人气，故而贪功。
<br><br>

 随着拉登之死的细节逐步曝光，人们发现，其实还是布什年间的关塔那摩监狱审讯之中，找到了有助于发现拉登藏身地的关键信使人物。而布什在任的时候，奥巴马一直攻击关塔那摩监狱虐囚政策，一直说要把该监狱关掉。虽然捕杀本・拉登，也不会因此让关塔那摩监狱丑闻变质，但为何不能客观地分析一下这场反恐战争中各方的付出，包括布什为关塔那摩所背的黑锅？
<br><br>

 成王败寇的思维，让很多人认为布什笨蛋，抓不住拉登，是奥巴马指挥有方。事实上情报系统的大整改，是布什的时代开启的。比如布什曾有感于情报部门、移民局等部门各行其是，故而改变了这种条块分割的局面，成立国土安全部，并着重强调各部门的协作沟通。那么为什么奥巴马打死了拉登，而布什没有呢？很多政策发挥效应，在时间上有一定的延后效应。比如布什时代经济的萧条，很多失败的金融和经济政策，是从克林顿种子，到了布什时代开花结果。
<br><br>

 追杀本・拉登的使命，是克林顿时代开始，在布什时代成为优先事项，到了奥巴马手里大功告成。在反恐战争、情报部门改组这一系列的战略举措上，小布什功不可没。虽然他是9・11之后被动反应，但“牛仔”总统的个性，让他的反恐政策和导向迅速成型。学者陈永杰先生在21世纪网所发《剿拉登将短期冲喜奥巴马》一文中称 “如果说布什完全没有功劳倒也说不过去。现在比较主流的看法是，成功击毙拉登是布什与奥巴马在外交政策上‘先张后弛’的意外结果，布什的非敌即友政策完成对拉登的财政与外交围堵，奥巴马‘去意识形态化’的外交政策，则把非盟友力量也笼络过来，增加了情报来源，成为最终剿灭拉登的必要条件。”与奥巴马到目前为止在此事上的表现相比，小布什的反馈十分平静，看不出多少私心。
<br><br>

 但我相信，历史不会因为一个人贪功就会让其长躺功劳簿，也不会因为一个人的辩解而让他的过失一笔勾销。群众可以糊涂一时，但是历史不会糊涂生生世世。一个领袖人物就应该有点历史眼光，为国家为人民多想想，不要小肚鸡肠，看到现任成功，就开始辩解自己当年的政策；看到现任失败，就看他们的笑话。这种政客，必将成为历史的笑话。
