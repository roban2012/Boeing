Chicago   is the third most populous city in the United States, after New York City and Los Angeles. With 2.7 million residents,[1] it is the most populous city in both the U.S. state of Illinois and the American Midwest. Its metropolitan area, sometimes called Chicagoland, is home to 9.5 million people and is the third-largest in the United States.[2] Chicago is the seat of Cook County.[n 1]<br><br>

Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837, near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed, and experienced rapid growth in the mid-nineteenth century.[6] Today, the city is an international hub for finance, commerce, industry, technology, telecommunications, and transportation, with O'Hare International Airport being the second-busiest airport in the world; it also has the largest number of U.S. highways, and railroad freight entering its region.[7] In 2010, Chicago was listed as an alpha+ global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[8] and ranks seventh in the world in the 2012 Global Cities Index.[9] As of 2012, Chicago had the third largest gross metropolitan product in the United States, after the New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, at a sum of US$571 billion.[10]<br><br>

In 2012, Chicago hosted 46.37 million international and domestic visitors, an overall visitation record.[11] Chicago's culture includes contributions to the visual arts, novels, film, theater, especially improvisational comedy, and music, particularly jazz, blues, soul, and the creation of house music. The city has many nicknames, which reflect the impressions and opinions about historical and contemporary Chicago. The best-known include the "Windy City" and "Second City."[12] Chicago has professional sports teams in each of the major professional leagues.

	<b><a name="T2">芝加哥历史</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

18世纪时，现在的芝加哥地区是伯塔瓦托米（Potawatomi）印第安部落的领地。1770年代来到这里的一个海地人是第一个外来的定居者，他娶伯塔瓦托米人为妻，并在这里开设了这一地区第一家货栈。1803年，美国陆军在此建立了迪尔伯恩要塞，后在1812年的迪尔伯恩要塞屠杀中被毁。1816年，伯塔瓦托米和其他附近的印第安部落与美国政府签订圣路易斯协定，让出了土地。1833年8月12日，芝加哥镇成立，当时拥有350名居民。随着定居人口的增加，1837年3月4日这里成为芝加哥市。<br><br>

在它历史的第一个百年中，芝加哥是当时世界上人口增长最快的城市之一，从19世纪初的空白起点增长到1900年已超过一百万。它是当时世界上人口超过一百万的城市中唯一在一个世纪前还不存在的城市。<br><br>

1848年沟通密歇根湖和密西西比河的伊利诺伊密歇根运河建成，沟通了两大水道之间的航运。同年，芝加哥的第一条铁路开始修建。自此，芝加哥开始成为连接美国东西部的重要交通枢纽。便捷的水陆运输极大地刺激了工商业的发展。城市的繁荣吸引了众多的外来者到此定居，其中包括大量的农村人口和新外国移民。1870年到1900年间，芝加哥的人口从29.9万猛增到170万。当地的制造业和零售业成为中西部经济的主宰力量，并很大程度的影响美国经济。<br><br>
 
1871年芝加哥大火之后，芝加哥得到快速的重建并很快恢复了增长。[2] 在重建期间，这里产生了世界上第一栋采用钢构架的摩天大楼，以此开始芝加哥不断创新的城市建筑陆续获得了世界性的声誉。1893年，芝加哥主办了哥伦布纪念世界博览会，获得极大的成功，共吸引到2750万游客前来参观。[3] 在此前一年，芝加哥大学也在此创建。<br><br>

这一时期的芝加哥被频繁的劳资冲突和混乱所困扰，其中包括1886年著名的干草市场暴乱。下层居民恶劣的生活条件和各种社会问题引发了一些象珍・亚当斯建立的霍尔馆（Hull House）一类的社会改革实验。芝加哥市也在城区规划和建设了多个大型的城市公园。自1855年起，芝加哥就开始建设美国大城市中第一个完备的污水排放系统。这些举措一定程度上改善了城市的面貌和普通市民的生活条件。
<br><br>
由于人口的快速增长和工商业的发展，作为城市主要水源的密歇根湖的边缘地带在此期间被严重污染。为解决饮水污染问题，市方在密歇根湖里两英里处建设了自来水厂的入水口，并通过水下管道将水引入城市的供水系统。可是这样的努力效果被证明是有限的，由于雨水可能把芝加哥河的污水带到入水口附近。1900年，这一问题终于得到彻底的解决。人们通过建设水位提升设施和闸门，将原本流入密歇根湖的芝加哥河的流向倒转，使其转而向南流入伊利诺伊河。从此，城市的污水不再注入密歇根湖。<br><br>
 
1920年代禁酒令时期，芝加哥黑社会势力横行，产生了像艾尔・卡彭这样臭名昭著的黑社会头子。这一期间，也开始有大量居住在南方的黑人迁入芝加哥和其他一些北方城市。1942年12月，世界上首次受控核反应试验在芝加哥大学成功，完成了曼哈顿计划的关键一环。
<br><br>
1955年，前伊利诺伊州参议员理查德・J・戴利当选为芝加哥市长，此后担任此职位长达21年。1950年代起，中上层居民逐渐开始向城市郊区的迁移，导致城市中心很多地段的衰落和贫民化。这一期间，芝加哥曾主办1968年民主党全国大会，建成了标志性的希尔斯大厦，约翰汉考克中心，麦考密克会展中心和奥黑尔机场。<br><br>

现任市长理查德・M・戴利，是原老市长理查德・J・戴利的儿子，政策注重提升芝加哥的环境质量，实施了一些复兴衰落街区，改善城市基础设施、沿湖和沿河城市景观的项目。芝加哥于2009年申办2016年夏季奥林匹克运动会，但是败给了巴西的里约热内卢。
<br><br>
芝加哥位于伊利诺伊州的东北角，濒临密歇根湖的西南端，地理坐标为41°53′0″N 87°39′0″W。芝加哥位于密西西比河水系和五大湖水系的分界线上。境内有两条河流，芝加哥河流经市中心，卡拉麦特河（Calumet River）则穿过城市南部的工业区。两条河流原来都流入密歇根湖。20世纪初，为使芝加哥河的城市污水不继续污染密歇根湖水，芝加哥河水流方向被倒转，通过运河向南汇入密西西比河水系。

Beginnings
<br><br>
The name "Chicago" is derived from a French rendering of the Native American word shikaakwa, translated as "wild onion" or "wild garlic", from the Miami-Illinois language.[13][14][15][16] The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as "Checagou" was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir written about the time.[17] Henri Joutel, in his journal of 1688, noted that the wild garlic, called "chicagoua," grew abundantly in the area.[14] During the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by a Native American tribe known as the Potawatomi, who had taken the place of the Miami and Sauk and Fox peoples.[18] The 1780s saw the arrival of the first known non-indigenous permanent settler in Chicago, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, who was of African and European (French) descent.[19][20][21]
<br><br>
In 1795, following the Northwest Indian War, an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over to the United States for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the Treaty of Greenville. In 1803, the United States Army built Fort Dearborn, which was destroyed in the War of 1812, Battle of Fort Dearborn and later rebuilt.[22] The Ottawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi tribes had ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis. The Potawatomi were eventually forcibly removed from their land following the Treaty of Chicago in 1833.[23][24][25]
Founding and 19th century
<br><br>
On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of around 200.[25] Within seven years it would grow to a population of over 4,000. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales commenced with Edmund Dick Taylor as U.S. receiver of public moneys. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837 and went on to become the fastest growing city in the world for several decades.[26]
<br><br>
As the site of the Chicago Portage,[27] the city emerged as an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, opened in 1848, which also marked the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the Great Lakes to connect to the Mississippi River.[28][29][30][31]
<br><br>
A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy.[32] The Chicago Board of Trade (established 1848) listed the first ever standardized 'exchange traded' forward contracts, which were called futures contracts.[33]
<br><br>
In the 1850s Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator Stephen Douglas, the champion of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and "popular sovereignty" approach to the issue of the spread of slavery.[34] These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln, to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for the nation's presidency at the 1860 Republican National Convention and went on to defeat Douglas in the general election, setting the stage for the American Civil War.[35]
<br><br>
To accommodate rapid population growth and demand for better sanitation, the city implemented various infrastructural improvements. In February 1856, the Chesbrough plan for the building of the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system was approved by the Common Council.[36] The project raised much of central Chicago to a new grade. While raising Chicago, and at first improving the health of the city, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the Chicago River, then into Lake Michigan, polluting the primary source of fresh water for the city. The city responded by tunneling two miles (3 km) out into Lake Michigan to newly built water cribs. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects to the Illinois River, which flows into the Mississippi River.[37][38][39]
<br><br>


In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire broke out, destroying an area of about 4 miles long and 1 mile wide, a large section of the city at the time.[40][41][42] Much of the city, including railroads and stockyards, survived intact,[43] and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone which would set the precedent for worldwide construction.[44][45] During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's first skyscraper in 1885, using steel-skeleton construction.[46][47]
<br><br>
Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from Europe and migrants from the Eastern United States. Of the total population in 1900 no less than 77% were foreign-born, or born in the United States of foreign parentage. Germans, Irish, Poles, Swedes and Czechs made up nearly two-thirds of the foreign-born population (by 1900, whites were 98.1% of the city's population).[48][49]
<br><br>
Labor conflicts followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the Haymarket affair on May 4, 1886. Concern for social problems among Chicago's immigrant poor led Jane Addams to co-found Hull House in 1889.[50] Programs developed there became a model for the new field of social work.[51]
<br><br>
During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later state laws, that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera, small pox, and yellow fever were not only passed, but also enforced. These in turn became templates for public health reform in many other cities and states.[52]
<br><br>
The city invested in many large, well-landscaped municipal parks, which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate and driving force for improving public health in Chicago was Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D., who established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866, created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with festering, shallow graves, and helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health in 1867 in response to an outbreak of cholera. Ten years later he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.[53]
<br><br>
In the 19th century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center, by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of 6 different downtown terminals.[54][55] In 1883, the standardized system of North American Time Zones was adopted by the general time convention of railway managers in Chicago.[56] This gave the continent its uniform system for telling time.
<br><br>
In 1893, Chicago hosted the World's Columbian Exposition on former marshland at the present location of Jackson Park. The Exposition drew 27.5 million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history.[57][58] The University of Chicago was founded in 1892 on the same South Side location. The term "midway" for a fair or carnival referred originally to the Midway Plaisance, a strip of park land that still runs through the University of Chicago campus and connects Washington and Jackson Parks.[59][60]
<br><br>

20th and 21st centuries
 <br><br>
The World War I period and the 1920s also saw a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted blacks from the Southern United States. Between 1910 and 1930, the black population of Chicago dramatically increased from 44,103 to 233,903.[61] Arriving in the hundreds of thousands during the Great Migration, the newcomers had an immense cultural impact, called the Chicago Black Renaissance, part of the New Negro Movement, in art, literature, and music.[62] Continuing racial tensions and violence, such as the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, also occurred.[63]
<br><br>
The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when the Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters, including Al Capone, Dion O'Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era.[64] Chicago was the location of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, where Al Capone sent men to gun down members of his rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.[65]
<br><br>
In 1924, Chicago was the first American city to have a homosexual-rights organization, the Society for Human Rights. This organization produced the first American publication for gays, Friendship and Freedom. Police and political pressure soon caused it to disband.[66]
<br><br>
In 1933, Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was fatally wounded in Miami, Florida during a failed assassination attempt on President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1933 and 1934, the city celebrated its centennial by hosting the Century of Progress International Exposition Worlds Fair.[67] The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago's founding.[68]
<br><br>




On December 2, 1942, physicist Enrico Fermi conducted the world's first controlled nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project. This led to the creation of the atomic bomb by the United States, which it used in World War II in 1945.[69]
<br><br>
Mayor Richard J. Daley, a Democrat, was elected in 1955, in the era of machine politics. Starting in the early 1960s due to blockbusting, many white residents, as in most American cities, left the city for the suburbs. Whole neighborhoods were completely changed based on race.[70] Structural changes in industry caused heavy losses of jobs for lower skilled workers. In 1966, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Albert Raby led the Chicago Freedom Movement, which culminated in agreements between Mayor Richard J. Daley and the movement leaders.[71]
<br><br>



Two years later, the city hosted the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention, which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall, including full-scale riots, or in some cases police riots, in city streets.[72] Major construction projects, including the Sears Tower (now known as the Willis Tower, which in 1974 became the world's tallest building), University of Illinois at Chicago, McCormick Place, and O'Hare International Airport, were undertaken during Richard J. Daley's tenure.[73] In 1979, Jane Byrne, the city's first female mayor, was elected. She helped mitigate crime in the Cabrini-Green housing project and guide Chicago's school system out of a financial crisis.[74]
<br><br>
In 1983, Harold Washington became the first black mayor of the city of Chicago. Washington's first term in office saw attention given to poor and previously neglected minority neighborhoods. He was re-elected in 1987 but died of a heart attack a short time later.[75] The balance of Washington's second term was served by 6th ward Alderman Eugene Sawyer.
<br><br>
Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, was elected in 1989. His accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for sustainable development. After successfully standing for re-election five times, and becoming Chicago's longest serving mayor, Richard M. Daley declined to run for a seventh term.[76][77]
<br><br>
On February 23, 2011, former Illinois Congressman and White House Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, won the mayoral election, beating five rivals with 55 percent of the vote,[78] and was sworn in as Mayor on May 16, 2011.

	<b><a name="T3">芝加哥经济</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
芝加哥是美国GDP第3高的大都会区（仅次于纽约和洛杉矶），2010年GDP高达5320亿美元。同时该都市区也被评为美国发展最均衡的经济体[8]。它被万事达卡全球贸易中心指数(MasterCard Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index)评为全球最重要的商业中心的第四名[9]。此外，芝加哥都市区新增的企业数在2001年到2008年这七年有六年一直位居美国第一位[10]。而且该市的科技创新力也名列美国第三[11]。在2009年，该市被瑞银集团评为全球最富的城市的第九位[12]。
<br><br>
芝加哥也是全球最重要的一个金融中心，是美国第二大商业中心区[13]。有12家财富500强公司的总部设立在此，如芝加哥联邦储备银行(Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago), 芝加哥股票交易所(Chicago Stock Exchange),芝加哥商品交易所,以及拥有纽约商品期货交易所和道琼斯指数(Dow Jones Indexes)的CME集团等[14]。由于芝加哥经济学派的影响，该市也有其他多种多样的交易市场[15]。
<br><br>
该市有美国第二大的劳力市场―估计有425万的工作人员[16]。该市有12个全球500强的公司总部，以及17个财经500强的公司总部。军工巨头波音公司的总部于2001年搬到芝加哥[17][18]，卡夫食品和麦当劳位于芝加哥的郊区，这三家公司都属于道琼斯工业平均指数的30大公司之列，联合航空总部也位于芝加哥。
<br><br>
制造业，印刷业，出版业和食品加工业在该地的经济方面占据比较大的份额。几个医药制造和服务公司如Baxter国际和美国雅培的总部位于这里。通用电气提供医疗健康服务的部门在该地设有分支机构。伊州和密歇根州为了通过五大湖运输货物，以及19世纪以来铁路的发展使得该地成为美国运输业的一大中心。在1840年代，芝加哥成为谷类作物的主要运输港口，在1850年代和1860年代，芝加哥港的猪肉和牛肉运输业得到了很大扩展。随着一些重要的肉类公司比如Armour and Company在该市的增多,为该地和美国创造了全球性的商机。尽管肉类加工业目前在该市的经济中已占很小的角色，不过芝加哥仍旧是这一产业的一大运输和分散中心。由于该地有大量消费者和许多大学毕业生，芝加哥也诞生了许多新兴的网络公司，如CareerBuilder,Orbitz, 37signals,Groupon和Feedburner[19]。
<br><br>
19世纪晚期，芝加哥曾是自行车时尚的重要组成部分，如Western Wheel Company采用冲压制造程序并大量地减少了消耗[20]。在20世纪早期，芝加哥是汽车生产革命的组成部分，如生产出Brass Era car的Bugmobile公司就成立于1907年[21]。现今Schwinn自行车公司总部也位于芝加哥。
<br><br>
芝加哥是一个主要的全球会展的举办地。该市主要的会展中心是McCormick Place，它由四个连接的建筑组成，是美国最大和世界第三大的会展中心[22]。在每年举办会展的数量方面，芝加哥位列美国第三，居于拉斯维加斯和奥兰多之后[23]。

Chicago has the third largest gross metropolitan product in the United States―approximately $532 billion according to 2010 estimates,[131][132] after only the urban agglomerations of New York City and Los Angeles, in the first and second place, respectively. The city has also been rated as having the most balanced economy in the United States, due to its high level of diversification.[133] Chicago was named the fourth most important business center in the world in the MasterCard Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index.[134] Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area recorded the greatest number of new or expanded corporate facilities in the United States for six out of the seven years from 2001 to 2008.[135] The Chicago metropolitan area has the third largest science and engineering work force of any metropolitan area in the nation.[136] In 2009 Chicago placed 9th on the UBS list of the world's richest cities.[137] Chicago was the base of commercial operations for industrialists John Crerar, John Whitfield Bunn, Richard Teller Crane, Marshall Field, John Farwell, Morris Selz, Julius Rosenwald and many other commercial visionaries who laid the foundation for Midwestern and global industry.
<br><br>
Chicago is a major world financial center, with the second largest central business district in the United States.[citation needed] The city is the headquarters of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (the Seventh District of the Federal Reserve). The city is also home to major financial and futures exchanges, including the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the "Merc"), which is owned, along with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) by Chicago's CME Group. The CME Group, in addition, owns the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the Commodities Exchange Inc. (COMEX) and the Dow Jones Indexes.[138] Perhaps due to the influence of the Chicago school of economics, the city also has markets trading unusual contracts such as emissions (on the Chicago Climate Exchange) and equity style indices (on the U.S. Futures Exchange). Chase Bank has its commercial and retail banking headquarters in Chicago's Chase Tower.[139]

The city and its surrounding metropolitan area are home to the second largest labor pool in the United States with approximately 4.25 million workers.[140] In addition, the state of Illinois is home to 66 Fortune 1000 companies, including those in Chicago.[141] The city of Chicago also hosts 12 Fortune Global 500 companies and 17 Financial Times 500 companies. The city claims one Dow 30 company: aerospace giant Boeing, which moved its headquarters from Seattle to the Chicago Loop in 2001.[142][143] Two more Dow 30 companies, Kraft Foods and McDonald's. are in the Chicago suburbs, as are Sears Holdings Corporation and the technology spin-offs of Motorola. Chicago is also home to United Continental Holdings, with headquarters in the United Building and operations center at Willis Tower, and its United Airlines subsidiary.
<br><br>
Manufacturing, printing, publishing and food processing also play major roles in the city's economy. Several medical products and services companies are headquartered in the Chicago area, including Baxter International, Boeing, Abbott Laboratories, and the Healthcare Financial Services division of General Electric. In addition to aircraft maker Boeing, which located its headquarters in Chicago in 2001, and United Airlines in 2011, GE Transportation moved its offices to the city in 2013, as did ThyssenKrupp North America, and agriculture giant Archer Daniels Midland.[7] Moreover, the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which helped move goods from the Great Lakes south on the Mississippi River, and of the railroads in the 19th century made the city a major transportation center in the United States. In the 1840s, Chicago became a major grain port, and in the 1850s and 1860s Chicago's pork and beef industry expanded. As the major meat companies grew in Chicago many, such as Armour and Company, created global enterprises. Though the meatpacking industry currently plays a lesser role in the city's economy, Chicago continues to be a major transportation and distribution center. Lured by a combination of large business customers, federal research dollars, and a large hiring pool fed by the area's universities, Chicago is also home to a growing number of web startup companies like CareerBuilder, Orbitz, 37signals, Groupon, and Feedburner.[144]
<br><br>
Chicago has been a hub of the Retail sector since its early development in America, when it was the home of Montgomery Ward, Sears, and Marshall Field's. Today the Chicago metro area is the home of several retailers, including Walgreens, Sears, OfficeMax, Ace Hardware, Claire's, and Crate & Barrel.
<br><br>
Late in the 19th century, Chicago was part of the bicycle craze, as home to Western Wheel Company, which introduced stamping to the production process and significantly reduced costs,[145] while early in the 20th century, the city was part of the automobile revolution, hosting the Brass Era car builder Bugmobile, which was founded there in 1907.[146] Chicago was also home to the Schwinn Bicycle Company.
<br><br>
Chicago is a major world convention destination. The city's main convention center is McCormick Place. With its four interconnected buildings, it is the largest convention center in the nation and third largest in the world.[147] Chicago also ranks third in the U.S. (behind Las Vegas and Orlando) in number of conventions hosted annually.[148]
<br><br>
In June 2012, Chicago had 391,000 unemployed with a 9.4% unemployment rate against a national average of 8.2%.

	<b><a name="T4">芝加哥大学</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
芝加哥大学（The University of Chicago 简称UChi）是一所位于美国伊利诺伊州芝加哥的私立、男女同校、无宗教派别的研究型大学，1891年由约翰・洛克菲勒创办，1892年10月1日正式开课。芝加哥大学是美国最富盛名的大学之一，该校师生先后共有89位获得诺贝尔奖。
<br><br>
芝加哥大学的前身是由美国浸信会建立的一所教会学校，该校与芝加哥大学同名，但在1886年由于财政问题而倒闭。1890年，在石油大王约翰.洛克菲勒的慷慨捐助后，芝加哥大学起死回生。这次捐款也被洛克菲勒本人称为“最明智的一次投资”。1891年7月1日，威廉・哈珀成为该校首任校长。1892年10月1日，芝加哥大学正式开课。最初建立的学院有：商学院（1898年），法学院（1902年）和东方研究所等。此后短短数十年内便一跃成为一所世界顶级大学。
<br><br>
在芝加哥大学第五任校长罗伯特・哈群斯在任的24年里，芝加哥大学经历了许多重大变革。哈群斯提出了旨在防止学术课程和职业课程过分专门化的“芝加哥计划”，对其他美国大学的本科通识教育产生了巨大影响。哈群斯建立了沿用至今的本科生核心课程计划（Common Core），并将研究学院重组为四个学部。在他的带领下，芝大渡过了大萧条。
1907年，芝加哥大学物理系第一任系主任阿尔伯特・迈克耳孙因首先进行光速的测量并发展了同位素年代测定法而成为美国第一个诺贝尔物理学奖获得者。1909年，罗伯特・安德鲁斯・密立根教授在学校的瑞尔森物理实验室进行油滴实验。通过该实验，计算出电子电荷，并为量子力学理论铺平了道路。二战期间，芝大在曼哈顿计划中扮演了重要角色。这一时期，大批物理学家聚集芝大，奠定了该校在自然科学界的地位。
<br><br>

作为曼哈顿计划的一部分，由格伦・西奥多・西博格的带领团队在芝加哥大学乔治・赫伯特・琼斯实验室于1942年9月首次分离并测量出新的放射性元素钚。费米(Enrico Fermi 1901-1954)及其助手们于1942年12月2日在芝加哥大学的壁球馆内建成了世界上第一座可控核反应堆，使它达到临界状态，产生可控的核裂变链式反应。这一成就是原子能时代的一个重要里程碑，为两年后的原子弹诞生奠定了基础，芝加哥大学也因此被称为“原子能诞生地”。<br><br>
20世纪60年代，随着美国反战运动以及女权主义的兴起，芝大校园内的学生运动进入高潮。1962年，学生占领校长办公室以抗议学校租赁政策。1969年，为抗议学校开除左翼文人马琳・迪克森，400名学生占领行政大楼达两周之久。<br><br>
自1969年诺贝尔经济学颁奖以来，共有28名经济学奖获奖者是芝大校友或教研人员。2013年，经济学系的拉尔斯・汉森和商学院的尤金・法马二位教授共同摘得诺贝尔经济学奖。1982年该校的经济学家，同时也教授MBA课程的乔治・斯蒂格勒荣获诺贝尔经济奖，是全球商学院教授获此殊荣的第一人。<br><br>

1891年，洛克菲勒经过慎重考虑后选择年仅35岁的哈珀作为筹备芝加哥大学的助手，不久之后哈珀因为出色的工作被任命为首任校长。芝加哥大学还未成形，哈珀便为该校制定了极为严格的教师和学生选拔标准。他毫不忌讳公开他对芝加哥大学的野心勃勃的设想，要在极短的时间内建成“一所可以和东部（哈佛和耶鲁所在地）所有学校媲美的大学”，要达到这个目的，必须“把所有的热情投入到无情的引进有才能的教师、学生和管理者中去”。<br><br>
为筹办芝加哥大学，哈珀发挥曾倾倒洛克菲勒的“天才的鼓动力”，说服了8位在任的大学校长和近20名的系主任辞职来芝加哥执教，这在教育史上几乎是空前绝后的。他去当时美国及世界顶尖的心理学研究中心克拉克大学（Clark University）访问，离开的时候“挖”走了三分之二的教师和一半的研究生。<br><br>
正是这种近乎偏执和狂热的办学热情，使得他在一年半的时间里在芝加哥大学建立了一个总数为120人的一流研究和教师团队，修建了10栋楼。到1894年，芝加哥大学已成为美国高等教育与研究的领袖之一。一座新的顶尖大学诞生了，如他所言：“（这里）每片碎屑都是新的，却如苍山一般牢固” 。哈珀受近代教育史上著名的“洪堡精神”（崇尚教学研究合一）的影响，想结合美国的人文学科大学与德国的研究性大学的优势办学，主张大学的目的是深入研究，大学生应该在地方社区完成大学的头两年基础课程以应付后两年的紧张学习――这一思想直接催生了几十年后覆盖全美的社区大学体系。<br><br>
在这种理念的驱使下，哈珀在课程上做了大胆创新，创立低年纪学生学院，全年不间断提供基础课程、不分寒暑假滚动式授课和学习，同时允许完成学业的学生在任意学年的任意时候毕业，然后进入“深入研究”阶段。为显示这种“不间断授课”的决心，他把芝加哥大学的第一堂课安排在了周六上午8：30，为了上好第一堂课，哈珀带领其他教职员工在前一夜通宵达旦工作，把刚送到的课桌和椅子安放好，并打扫卫生。<br><br>

虽然哈珀本人是宗教史学家，但他毫不害怕在必要时向学术传统挑战，无论是入学标准还是毕业标准他都不愿芝加哥大学对任何其他大学亦步亦趋。他开了顶尖大学招收女生和任用女教师的先河，同时从建校那天起芝加哥大学的大门就是向所有少数民族敞开的；积极支持美国大学的第一个社会学系的创建，并亲自担纲了美国的第一个延伸教育系统的建立，以提供函授和夜校、周末学习课程给那些不能在通常时间或在通常地点上课的人；他率先通过广告、公告栏和群发邮件对芝加哥大学课程和活动进行全方位的宣传，他较早建立严密的公共关系网以维护大学的资金运转，他为芝加哥城和美国政府的多个委员会服务以扩大芝加哥大学影响。<br><br>
在管理上，他大胆放权，鼓励行政人员发掘人才和新课程。他在自己一手支持创立的社会学系的教授的帮助下，把芝加哥大学的行政等级和管理机构改革成当时其他大学努力效仿的高效、简单模式。<br><br>
所有这些令人眼花缭乱改革的都是在短短两年间上马并同时进行的，以至于芝加哥大学不可避免地成为最让媒体和大众应接不暇的大学。这些在当时被称作“哈珀闹剧系列”的话题后来被正名为“一场高等教育革命”。<br><br>
在芝加哥大学任校长的14年间，哈珀被称为“芝加哥的匆忙的年轻人”。尽管行政事务占据了大量的时间，哈珀总能挤出时间教课和写作。他坚信行政人员不能独立于授课之外，所以在兼任校长与系主任的情况下，仍然给自己排了全职教师的课。授课的同时他要忙于参加社交以及与捐赠者保持密切的关系，筹集资金用来建立新的图书馆、实验室、出版社、研究生院；他同时还要关注芝加哥大学足球队的体育优势……即使是在他和癌症斗争的最后岁月也不间断地上大量的课。<br><br>
哈珀于1906年死于癌症，年仅49岁。留下了一所伟大的大学，成为其他大学公开或私下效仿的对象，被称为“教师们的教师”。历史学教授弗雷德里克・卢道夫（Frederick Rudolph）曾在1962年的著作《美国大学史》中写道：“芝加哥大学的创立对美国高等教育整体风貌的塑造是那个年代任何其他事件都无法企及的，它的创立是美国历史上代表时代精神的事件之一。”1894年至1904年间在哈珀时代任教的教育哲学家杜威更是通过把芝加哥大学当成“实验室”而总结出一套在世界范围内影响深远的教育理念。<br><br>

In the beginning, an idea<br><br>

“If the first faculty had met in a tent, this still would have been a great university,” said President Robert Maynard Hutchins, the University’s fifth president, in his 1929 inaugural address.
<br><br>
The first faculty assembled on Opening Day, 1892, were indeed an impressive bunch: lured from colleges all over the country, they had been drawn to Chicago by the idea of a community of great scholars. As Charles O. Whitman, who left Clark University to head the biology department at the new institution, enthusiastically put it, “The time has now come when we must recognize and live up to the necessity for greater organic unity among kindred sciences.”
‘Bran splinter new’<br><br>

William Rainey Harper, the University’s first president, envisioned a university that was “‘bran splinter new,’ yet as solid as the ancient hills”―a modern research university, combining an English-style undergraduate college and a German-style graduate research institute. The University of Chicago fulfilled Harper’s dream, quickly becoming a national leader in higher education and research: an institution of scholars unafraid to cross boundaries, share ideas, and ask difficult questions.<br><br>
A solid investment<br><br>

Founded in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society and oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, the University’s land was donated by Marshall Field, owner of the legendary Chicago department store that bore his name. Rockefeller described the donation as “the best investment I ever made.”<br><br>
Equal opportunity<br><br>

Harper, a young Biblical scholar from Yale, incorporated into UChicago’s early charter a commitment to gender equality in both undergraduate and graduate education and, remarkably, considering the initial intention to found a Baptist institution, to an atmosphere of nonsectarianism. This commitment to an accepting environment and equal opportunity distinguished the University in its early years and holds firm today.<br><br>
A leader in higher education<br><br>

UChicago’s leadership was noted by Frederick Rudolph, professor of history at Williams College, who wrote in his 1962 study, The American College and University: A History, “No episode was more important in shaping the outlook and expectations of American higher education during those years than the founding of the University of Chicago, one of those events in American history that brought into focus the spirit of an age.”<br><br>
Educational innovations<br><br>

One of Harper’s curricular innovations was to run classes year-round, allowing students to graduate at whatever time of year they completed their studies. Appropriately enough, the first class was held on a Saturday at 8:30 a.m. Just as appropriately, Harper and the other faculty members had pulled a feverish all-nighter beforehand, unpacking and arranging desks, chairs, and tables in the newly constructed Cobb Hall.<br><br>
Tradition and innovation<br><br>

The first buildings copied the English Gothic style of architecture, complete with towers, spires, cloisters, and gargoyles. By 1910, UChicago had adopted more traditions, including a coat of arms that bore a phoenix emerging from the flames and a Latin motto, Crescat Scientia, Vita Excolatur (“Let knowledge grow from more to more; and so be human life enriched.”).<br><br>
Changing the face of higher education<br><br>

During Robert Hutchins’s tenure as president, from 1929 to 1951, he established many of the undergraduate curricular innovations that UChicago is known for today. These included a curriculum dedicated specifically to interdisciplinary education, comprehensive examinations instead of course grades, courses focused on the study of original documents and classic works, and an emphasis on discussion, rather than lectures. While the Core curriculum has changed substantially since Hutchins’s time, original texts and small discussion sections remain a hallmark of a University of Chicago education.<br><br>
Firsts in athletics<br><br>

In addition, Hutchins is famously remembered for another bold decision. With its emphasis on academics and research, it’s easy to forget that UChicago was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. The University’s first athletic director, Amos Alonzo Stagg, was also the first tenured coach in the nation, holding the position of Associate Professor and Director of the Department of Physical Culture and Athletics. And in 1935, senior Jay Berwanger was awarded the first Heisman Trophy (which is proudly displayed today in the Ratner Athletic Center on campus). Just four years later, however, Hutchins abolished the football team, citing the need to focus on academics rather than athletics. Varsity football was not reinstated until 1969.<br><br>
Evolution and growth<br><br>

In the early 1950s, Hyde Park, once a solidly middle-class neighborhood, began to decline. In response, UChicago became a major sponsor of an urban renewal effort for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood’s architecture and street plan. As just one example, in 1952, 55th Street had 22 taverns; today, the street features extra-wide lanes for automobile traffic, the twin towers of University Park Condominiums (I. M. Pei, 1961) and one bar, the Woodlawn Tap.<br><br>
The modern era<br><br>

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the University began to add modern buildings to the formerly all-Gothic campus. These included the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (Eero Saarinen, 1959) and the School of Social Service Administration (Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, 1965). In 1963, the University acquired the Robie House, built by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1909. By 1970, the Regenstein Library―at seven stories, and almost a block square, the largest building on campus by far―occupied the site of Old Stagg Field.<br><br>

UChicago experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when students occupied President George Beadle’s office in a protest over the University’s off-campus rental policies. In 1969, more than 400 students, angry about the dismissal of a popular professor, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks
<br><br>
In 1978, Hanna Gray, Professor of History, was appointed President of the University, becoming the first woman to serve as president of a major research university. During Gray’s tenure, both undergraduate and graduate enrollment increased, and a new science quadrangle was completed.<br><br>
Chicago’s second century
<br><br>
In the 1990s, controversy returned to campus―but this time, the point of contention was the undergraduate curriculum. After a long discussion process that received national attention, the new curriculum was announced in 1998. While continuing the dedication to interdisciplinary general education, the new curriculum included a new emphasis on foreign language acquisition and expanded international and cross-cultural study opportunities.<br><br>
Uniting the sciences<br><br>

Today, under the leadership of Robert J. Zimmer, the University’s 13th president, UChicago continues to evolve. Gothic architecture has made room for modern gems like the Charles M. Harper Center, home to the Graduate School of Business, and the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts. And the 400,000-square-foot Gordon Center for Integrative Science, which opened in 2006, can house 800 scientists, researchers, and students.<br><br>
National laboratories<br><br>

But amid this physical change, UChicago’s interdisciplinary approach to world-changing research and an insatiable commitment to inquiry continue, demonstrated in its partnerships with the Argonne and Fermi national laboratories, its world-class Medical Center, its tradition of accomplishment in economic research, its dedication to social services and community growth, and the many accomplishments of its faculty, researchers, and students.<br><br>
Continuing the tradition<br><br>

Harper articulated his hope and vision for the University of Chicago at the very first faculty meeting in 1892, saying: “The question before us is how to become one in spirit, not necessarily in opinion.”<br><br>
<a href= "link01.html">GE 的 继承人选们</a><br><br>

The University’s commitment to answering that question―and many others―continues to guide it today.<br><br>

As President Zimmer said in his address at UChicago’s 487th convocation, “If we take ourselves back to the University in its early years, we would find many major differences from what we observe today…And yet, many of us connected to this university feel that we might just as easily have been there―that going back to the University in its early days, or in fact at any time since its inception, we would know unmistakably that we were at the University of Chicago.<br><br>

“Why is this? The University of Chicago, from its very inception, has been driven by a singular focus on inquiry…with a firm belief in the value of open, rigorous, and intense inquiry and a common understanding that this must be the defining feature of this university. Everything about the University of Chicago that we recognize as distinctive flows from this commitment.”

荷兰是一个议会制君主立宪国。正式国名为尼德兰王国（Kingdom of Netherlands，亦译作荷兰王国）。首都为阿姆斯特丹，政府所在地为海牙。	<br><br>
Amsterdam 即 阿姆斯特丹（荷兰首都）。<br><br>
阿姆斯特丹（Amsterdam），是荷兰首都及最大城市，位于该国西部省份北荷兰省。繁华知名的国际大都市；欧洲第四大航空港（前三为伦敦，巴黎，法兰克福），该城市所处的兰斯台德都市圈为欧洲第六大都市圈，人口750万[1]。<br><br>
其名称源于Amstel dam，这表明了该城市的起源：一个位于阿姆斯特尔河上的水坝，即今水坝广场址。12世纪晚期一个小渔村建于此，而后由于贸易的迅猛发展，阿姆斯特丹在荷兰黄金时代一跃而成为世界上最重要的港口。在那个时代，该城是金融和钻石的中心。19和20世纪，该城扩展，许多新的街坊与近郊住宅区形成。<br><br>
阿姆斯特丹是荷兰的金融和文化首都。许多大型跨国公司的全球总部都设于此，其中包括飞利浦和ING等7家世界500强企业的全球总部。作为泛欧交易所的一部分，阿姆斯特丹证券交易所坐落于城市中心。阿姆斯特丹有很多旅游景点，包括历史悠久的运河网、荷兰国家博物馆、凡・高博物馆、安妮之家、红灯区以及许多大麻咖啡馆。每年有大约420万游客来此观光。<br><br>
作为当前荷兰第一大城市，阿姆斯特丹历经了从渔村到国际化大都市的发展过程，经历了辉煌与破坏，以及世界大战的洗礼，从一定程度上讲，她的历史也是荷兰历史的一个缩影。<br><br>


16世纪，由于当时统治荷兰的西班牙王室开始推行新的税收政策，以及建立迫害新教徒的西班牙宗教裁判所，荷兰人开始反抗西班牙国王腓力二世和他的继任者。新兴资本孕育出了一大批新教徒，再加上加尔文教徒们开始反抗，这场起义不久升级为“80年战争”，并最终促成了荷兰的独立。起义的领袖，“值得赞美的奥兰治拿骚的威廉”宣布荷兰北方8个省（包括阿姆斯特丹）独立为荷兰共和国，他也成为了第一位荷兰皇室成员。他推行了一系列较为宽松的宗教政策，使得伊比利亚半岛的犹太人、法国的胡格诺派、佛兰德斯的富商和印刷工，以及来自西班牙控制的低地国家的经济与宗教难民在阿姆斯特丹找到了安全的栖身之所。佛兰德印刷工的涌入以及对各种思想的包容使得阿姆斯特丹成为了欧洲的自由出版中心。<br><br>

17世纪被认为是阿姆斯特丹的黄金年代。荷兰商船从阿姆斯特丹开往波罗的海、北美洲和非洲，以及今天的印尼、印度、斯里兰卡和巴西，由此构建了世界贸易网络的基础。荷兰东印度公司与荷兰西印度公司发行的大量股票为阿姆斯特丹商人所拥有。这两个公司所夺得的海外属地后来演变为了荷兰的殖民地。阿姆斯特丹也在此时成为了欧洲航运和世界融资的中心。1602年，荷兰东印度公司的阿姆斯特丹办公室开始出售自己的股票，并成为了世界上第一家证券交易所。<br><br>
然而，从18世纪开始，阿姆斯特丹的繁荣开始褪色。荷兰与英国和法国之间的战争，打击了处于巅峰的阿姆斯特丹。后来，荷兰被拿破仑率领的法国军队所占领。直到1815年，摆脱法国统治的荷兰与现在的比利时和卢森堡组成荷兰王国，这座城市才迎来了发展的第二次春天。
19世纪末期也被称作阿姆斯特丹的第二个黄金年代。该市新建成了一些博物馆、中央车站以及阿姆斯特丹音乐厅。与此同时，她也迎来了工业革命。阿姆斯特丹-莱茵运河（Amsterdam-Rhine Canal）的成功开掘也是这座城市直接连接到了莱茵河；同时北海运河也缩短了城市与北海的距离。两项工程极大地促进了与欧洲及世界其他地方的商业交流。1906年，作家约瑟夫・康拉德用“海之镜”精辟的从海边眺望阿姆斯特丹的景象。第一次世界大战前，该城市的规模开始拓展，建立了一些新的郊区。<br><br>

Center of the Dutch Golden Age<br><br>

The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's Golden Age, during which it became the wealthiest city in the world.[25] Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the Baltic Sea, North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became Dutch colonies. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading Financial Centre of the world.[26] In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first stock exchange by trading in its own shares.<br><br>

1556年帝国皇帝卡尔五世（1519年―1556年在位）退位，将西班牙和低地（被称为北方省）分给他的儿子腓力二世，将奥地利等其他地区以及哈布斯堡王朝正统分给他的弟弟斐迪南一世。就这样，北方省属于西班牙王国。<br><br>
1568年，因反抗西班牙国王的中央集权和对新教加尔文派的迫害，爆发持续80年北方省反抗西班牙的八十年战争。<br><br>
1579年北方省中的七省（荷兰、比利时和卢森堡的区域）成立了乌得勒支联盟，共同反对西班牙统治。这被认为现代荷兰的开始。<br><br>
1581年7月26日，来自荷兰各起义城市的代表在海牙郑重宣布：废除西班牙国王对荷兰各省的统治权，联盟正式宣布独立，成立荷兰共和国（正式名称为尼德兰联合共和国）。战争在继续，直到1648年西班牙国王菲利普四世才签订《明斯特条约》，承认七低地尼德兰七省联合共和国。<br><br>
1588年，七个省份联合起来，宣布成立荷兰联省共和国。这是一个在人类历史上前所未有的国家。很多历史学家说，它是世界上第一个“赋予商人阶层充分的政治权利的国家”。[1]<br><br>
称霸<br><br>
从西班牙获得独立之后，荷兰发展成为17世纪航海和贸易强国。荷兰的商船数目超过欧洲所有国家商船数目总和，被誉为“海上马车夫”。荷兰在世界各地建立殖民地和贸易据点。这段时期在荷兰被称为“黄金年代”。<br><br>
1602年，在共和国大议长奥登巴恩维尔特的主导下，荷兰联合东印度公司成立。<br><br>
1648年西班牙正式承认荷兰独立，荷兰已达到了商业繁荣的顶点，成为17世纪海上殖民强国，继西班牙之后成为世界上最大的殖民国家。
1656年，荷兰使团到达北京。<br><br>
到17世纪中叶，荷兰联省共和国的全球商业霸权已经牢固地建立起来。此时，荷兰东印度公司已经拥有15000个分支机构，贸易额占到全世界总贸易额的一半。悬挂着荷兰三色旗的10000多艘商船游弋在世界的五大洋之上：当时，全世界共有2万艘船，荷兰有1.5万艘。比英，法，德诸国船只的总数还多。<br><br>
1688年9月，一支庞大的舰队从阿姆斯特丹港拔锚起航，这些船上载着荷兰的最高执政官威廉三世和两万名荷兰士兵。威廉三世此行是受英国议会的邀请，前去保护英国国民的“宗教自由和财产”。<br><br>
衰落<br><br>
17世纪后期，荷兰先后与英国、法国交战，在海上荷兰败于英国（英荷战争），在陆地荷兰败于法国（法荷战争），从而衰落下来。<br><br>
1795年荷兰被法国占领。<br><br>

18世纪后，荷兰殖民体系逐渐瓦解。<br><br>
1806年拿破仑之弟任国王，荷兰被封为王国。<br><br>
1810年并入法国。<br><br>
1814年脱离法国，翌年，荷兰和比利时、卢森堡成立荷兰王国（1830年比利时脱离荷兰独立）。<br><br>
1848年成为君主立宪国。一战期间保持中立。二战初期宣布中立。<br><br>
1940年5月被德国军队侵占，王室和政府迁至英国，成立流亡政府。<br><br>
战后<br><br>
1945年恢复独立，战后放弃中立政策，加入北约和欧共体及后来的欧盟。<br><br>

圣彼得堡 ，位于俄罗斯西北部，波罗的海沿岸，涅瓦河口。列宁格勒州的首府，俄罗斯[2]第二大城市。圣彼得堡是俄罗斯第二大政治、经济中心，也是俄西北地区中心城市，全俄重要的水陆交通枢纽[3]。1712年彼得大帝迁都到彼得堡，一直到1918年的200多年的时间里这里只都是俄罗斯文化，政治，经济的中心。又称为俄罗斯的“北方首都”。它拥有4000多个工业企业。圣彼得堡是俄罗斯通往欧洲的窗口，也是一座科学技术和工业高度发展的国际化城市[4]。拥有众多的高等院校、科学研究机构，被称为俄罗斯的科学、文化艺术和首都。<br><br>

1703年5月27日由俄国沙皇彼得一世下令建造，由该城的第一座建筑物――扼守涅瓦河河口的圣彼得保罗要塞命名。城名直接译自德文“SanktPeterburg”。1914年，第一次世界大战爆发后，俄国出现反日耳曼情绪，沙皇政府遂将圣彼得堡改名为彼得格勒。其后苏联成立，为纪念领导者列宁于十月革命时曾于该市发动革命，于1924年列宁逝世后，将市名改为列宁格勒。1991年苏联解体后，经市民投票，恢复圣彼得堡的旧名。<br><br>
在1703年5月27日以圣三一之名，于兔子岛上举行了隆重的圣彼得堡奠基仪式；彼得大帝首先在涅瓦河三角洲的兔子岛上修建了彼得保罗要塞，驻重兵把守，以防御瑞典军队的进攻；至此，波罗的海出海口从此纳入俄罗斯版图，彼得大帝创建了波罗的海舰队，使俄罗斯在历史上第一次拥有了自己的海军，而他也当之无愧的称谓俄罗斯的海军之父。<br><br>

圣彼得堡始建于1703年，至今已有300多年的历史，市名源自耶稣的弟子圣徒彼得。1712年，圣彼得堡成为俄国首都。其后200余年，它始终是俄罗斯帝国的心脏。圣彼得堡位于波罗的海芬兰湾东岸，涅瓦河河口，是俄罗斯第二大城、重要的工业中心和交通枢纽。城市发端于1703年，彼得大帝在涅瓦河口的兔子岛上建立彼得保罗要塞，后扩建为城，称圣彼得堡。1712年俄国首都从莫斯科迁到这里，持续200余年。1914年改称彼得格勒，1924年列宁逝世后又命名为列宁格勒，1991年苏联解体后恢复圣彼得堡旧名。涅瓦河三角洲上数十条纵横交错的水道和运河，把大地分割成近百个小岛，靠400多座桥梁相连，使圣彼得堡具有独特的“水城”和“桥城”景观。中心城区在大涅瓦河南岸，全市最繁华的涅瓦大街横贯城区，海港、河港和各类工厂分布在外围的瓦西里耶夫岛区、彼得格勒区和维堡区，昔日帝都留下的俄罗斯古典建筑群和名胜古迹比比皆是，如彼得罗巴甫洛夫斯克要塞、冬宫与皇宫广场、夏花园与夏宫、海军总部大厦、圣伊萨克大教堂、十二月党人广场、斯莫尔尼宫、俄罗斯博物馆、喋血教堂、驷马桥、……涅瓦河哺育了灿烂辉煌的俄罗斯文化，使圣彼得堡成为著名的科学文化城，罗蒙诺索夫、门捷列夫、普希金、果戈里等许多杰出的科学家、文学家都在这里生活和工作过，城内拥有数以百计的科研机构，数十所高等院校，以及众多博物馆和图书馆、影剧院等等。<br><br>

彼得大帝，彼得一世（1672─1725），原名彼得・阿列克谢耶维奇・罗曼诺夫，是沙皇阿列克谢・米哈伊洛维奇・罗曼诺夫之子，俄国罗曼诺夫王朝第四代沙皇（1682─1725）。<br><br>


彼得于1672年6月9日生于莫斯科。1725年2月8日去世。他是沙皇阿列克谢・米哈伊洛维奇和他的第二个妻子维塔利娅・纳利什基娜的独生子。彼得不到4岁父亲就去世了。因为米哈伊洛维奇的第一妻子还为他生了13个孩子，所以就王位的继承人问题展开了一场漫长的殊死斗争。姐姐索菲娅・阿列克谢耶夫娜做了几年摄政王，直到1689年退位。彼得地位才真正稳固。<br><br>
彼得仪表非凡，高大魁梧，也是世界最高的皇帝。精力充沛，潇洒欢快。但是他时常发脾气，饮酒过度时就大发雷霆。彼得除了政治和军事才能外，还对射击、印刷、造船等做过研究。<br><br>
彼得结过两次婚。他17岁时与欧多克亚结婚，他俩只在一起生活了一周的时间。他26岁时把她送进了一所修道院。1712年他与她离婚并同另一位女子结婚，彼得与他的原配夫人有一个儿子叫阿历克谢，终日不学无术，但是父子俩的关系也相当恶化，他曾出逃外国。1718年阿历克谢因反对彼得和通敌被捕入狱，遭受严刑拷打，终于死在狱中[2]。他第二个妻子叶卡捷琳娜是一位出身寒微的立陶宛女子（在大北方战争中被俄国俘虏才到了俄国）。彼得大帝热心于俄国的福祉，也为俄罗斯的发展付出一生。于1725年初在圣彼得堡死去，终年52岁。他的继位人是他的第二任妻子叶卡捷琳娜一世，接下来是彼得二世。<br><br>

1697至1698年间，彼得到西欧作了一次长途旅行，一次为他随后的统治定下了基调的旅行。他以一个下士彼得・米哈伊洛夫的身份，率领了一个大约由250人组成的“庞大的使团”。由于彼得使用了一个假名（鲁尤特尔・米海伊洛夫），因而他看到了许多否则就无法看到的事物。在这次旅行期间，他为荷兰的荷兰东印度公司当了一个时期的船长，还在英国造船厂工作过，在普鲁士学过射击。他走访工厂、学校、博物馆、军火库，甚至还参加了英国议会举行的一届会议。总之，他尽了最大的努力学习西方的文化、科学、工业及行政管理方法。<br><br>
1698年当几位大臣来问候远途归来的彼得大帝时，他已经开始系统引进国外新式武器和战略技术，还建立了一支强大的海军。在经济方面，彼得大力鼓励工商业的发展，允许企业主买进整村的农奴到工厂做工，批准外国人在俄国开办工厂。为了鼓励西方工艺和技术的引进，他把许多西方技术人员带入俄国，还派遣许多年轻的俄国人到东欧去学习。<br><br>

在大北方战争期间（1700年-1721年），也就是彼得在位数年后，俄罗斯帝国开始寻求同盟以对抗瑞典，来争夺波罗的海的控制权，这场战争的意义在于如果控制该地区，中欧以及东欧也就是囊中之物，这场战争也是损失最惨重的战争之一，消耗了具有象征性的财经资源，也是彼得继承父祖辈行政系统后必须开始集中控制资源 [1]，在彼得大帝率领国情访问团（日本人也这么干过。还是要走出去啊）考察诸国政情时，他也顺便和欧洲强权进行外交谈判，以结合反瑞典以及鄂图曼帝国的势力，他周游西欧各国以求未来一步步的带领俄罗斯进入工业经济的体系，尽管俄罗斯拥有相当庞大的国土以及资源，但是大部分的工厂都有效率低落的弊病，以致于经济发展严重受阻，彼得坚信他这些宏观的改革不只是在增加本身的权力，而是会增进政府的效能并加惠于民。<br><br>


在政治上，改革的目的是建立完整的中央集权统治，加强工作效率。剥夺贵族领主杜马会议的职能，代之以参政院，下设11个委员会（实际上相当于西方国家的“部”）负责具体工作；罢黜大教长，代之以宗教院，使教会成为国家政权的一部分；划分行政区域，将全国分为50个省。彼得还颁布了一个“职能表”，将文武官员分成14个不同的等级，所有的官员不管门第出身，都要从最低一级做起，靠功绩晋升。
<br><br>


在社会问题上，彼得也主张实行西方化。他颁布法令，规定人人都不得蓄胡子（虽然他后来对此项法令做了修改），要求宫廷人员必须穿西装，鼓励吸烟和喝咖啡。虽然他制订的政策有许多在当时遭到了强烈的反对，但是这些政策带来了长期的影响：俄国这个由贵族阶级统治的国家最终在很多方面都实行了西方的风俗和文化。<br><br>
可想而知，彼得认为俄国东正教会是一股落后的、反动的势力。彼得成功地对东正教会实行了部分改组，并在很大的程度上获得了对它的控制。彼得在俄国创办非宗教学校，鼓励发展科学。他还引进了儒略历，并使俄文字母现代化。在他的统治期间，俄国创办了第一家报社。
俄国现代化和西方化开展了大规模的改革。彼得在位期间鼓励工商业发展。他统治下，城镇规模扩大了，资产阶级在数量上增长了。
除了所有这些内务改革外，彼得还对外交政策实行改革，这对未来产生了重要的影响。在他的领导下，俄国在南部与土耳其交战，在北部与瑞典交战。与土耳其初战告捷，于1696年攻克了亚速港，从而在某方面来说给俄国开辟了通往黑海之路。但是在他的统治晚期，土耳其在战斗中占了上风，1711年他被迫把亚速港交还给土耳其。<br><br>
同瑞典作战的整个局势几乎与同土耳其作战的情形正相反；俄国人初战失利，但赢得了最终的胜利。1700年，俄国与丹麦和萨克森结盟同瑞典展开了一场战争，当时瑞典是一个主要的军事强国（波兰后来也对瑞典宣战）。1700年俄军在纳尔瓦战役中失败。这次战役之后，瑞典国王就把注意力转向其他敌人。与此同时，彼得重建俄国军队。瑞典和俄国再次交战，1707年瑞典军队在波尔塔瓦彻底失败。<br><br>
俄国通过战争吞并的领土大体上包括爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和芬兰附近的一片重要领土。虽然征服的领土并不很大但却很重要，因为它给俄国提供了波罗的海上的一个出口，因而提供了一个“t望欧洲的窗口”。彼得在涅瓦河两岸，即在征服瑞典所获的土地的一部分上，建立了一座新城市──圣彼得堡（后来的列宁格勒）。1712年他把首都从莫斯科迁到圣彼得堡。从此，圣彼得堡就成了俄国与西欧交往的主要地点。彼得推行的许多国内政策和多次展开的对外战争当然要付出很大的代价，不可避免地要强行增收赋税。高税收和改革本身激怒了许多俄国人，出现了几起叛乱事件，但是都被彼得无情地镇压下去了。虽然彼得在自己的鼎盛时期就有许多敌手，但是今天西方和共产党的史学家们都一致认为彼得是俄国沙皇中最伟大的沙皇。<br><br>

大北方战争[1]（1700～1721），又称为第二次北方战争，是俄国为了夺取波罗的海的出海口及与瑞典争霸的战争。战争的结果是俄国从此称霸波罗的海，而瑞典则从此衰退，由欧洲列强的名单上消失。<br><br>


在1560至1658年间，瑞典形成了一个以芬兰湾为中心的波罗的海帝国，包括卡列利阿，因格里亚，爱沙尼亚和立窝尼亚。在三十年战争中，瑞典在德意志也得到了大片领地，包括西波美拉尼亚，维斯马，不莱梅公国和费尔登。同时瑞典还征服了丹麦和挪威在松德海峡（The Sound）以北的领地。这些胜利可能要归因于训练有素的军队，尽管其规模相对较小，但是比大多数欧陆军队专业化程度高得多。尤其是其专业军事训练使得其可以维持高比例的小型火枪队。但是由于战争费用不能由占领区提供，瑞典最终证明不能在旷日持久的战争中维持其军队。<br><br>
大动乱期间外国对俄国的干涉使瑞典在《斯托尔博沃条约》（1617）大有斩获。该条约剥夺了俄国通往波罗的海的直接出海口，意味着俄国从此不再有挑战瑞典地区霸权的实力。俄国的命运在17世纪后半叶得到了逆转，尤其是在彼得大帝即位后，他一直寻求夺回之前的损失并重建在波罗的海的地位。17世纪90年代末，探险家约翰・帕特库尔通过《普列奥布拉任斯科耶条约》成功将俄国，丹麦和萨克森结成联盟，三国于是于1700年发动了进攻。<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
纽约(New York)，是纽约大都会区的核心，美国第一大城市，北美洲第一大城市，其巨大的经济与政治影响力在世界上首屈一指。纽约市位于美国大西洋海岸的东北部，紧邻的哈德逊河让纽约市享有运航之便，坐拥世界上最大的天然港口之一纽约湾，纽约城区大多落在曼哈顿、斯塔滕岛和长岛，因为土地狭小所以人口密度很高。<br><br>
纽约同时也是美国政治、经济、文化及交通等领域的枢纽中心。与英国伦敦、日本东京并称为"世界级城市"。纽约直接影响着全球的经济、金融、媒体、政治、教育、娱乐与时尚界。联合国总部和世界上很多国际机构和跨国公司的总部都设在纽约。2013年纽约GDP位列世界第一。另外，纽约还是世界三大金融中心之首（另外两个为伦敦和香港），是世界的经济中心，被人们誉为“世界之都”。在2014年世界城市金融发展指数位居世界第一。[1]<br><br>
纽约的金融区，以曼哈顿下城的华尔街为龙头，被称为世界的金融中心，同时世界上最大的证券交易所纽约证券交易所也位于此地。曼哈顿的房地产是世界上最为昂贵的地区之一，同时曼哈顿的唐人街是西半球最为密集的华人集中地。纽约还是许多高等学府的所在地，其中包括纽约大学和洛克菲勒大学等。纽约地铁是世界上最为发达的快速交通系统之一，提供一日24小时一周七日的服务。<br><br>

1524年，乔瓦尼・达韦拉扎诺成为第一个历史记载的造访纽约的欧洲人。达韦拉扎诺是一名来自佛罗伦萨的探险者，效忠于法国。他乘着太子妃号进入了今日的纽约港区，宣布此地为法国所有，并将之命名为新昂古莱姆。<br><br>
1602 年荷兰派遣亨利・哈德逊前往北美洲找寻新乐土，1609年抵达纽约湾并沿着河流北上，隔年哈德逊带着北美洲的土产和毛皮回到荷兰，许多荷兰商人对这片拥有丰富资源的土地，产生高度的兴趣并定居于此，荷兰人并以“新尼德兰”（New Nederland）命名。<br><br>

1624年，荷兰人在加弗纳斯岛建立皮草贸易点，由此欧洲人在新尼德兰开始了正式的永久居留。1625年，阿姆斯特在曼哈顿岛上开始兴建，后称作“新阿姆斯特丹”（Nieuw Amsterdam）。荷兰殖民总督彼得・米纽特于1626年从勒纳佩人处以60荷兰盾（2006年约为1000美元）购得曼哈顿岛。<br><br>

1664年，新尼德兰总督彼得・斯特伊维桑特投降，将新阿姆斯特丹拱手让给了英国人。英国人随即将此地更名为“纽约”，以海军大臣约克公爵（即日后的詹姆士二世）命名。第二次英荷战争结束后，英国正式获取新阿姆斯特丹（纽约），以与荷兰交换印度尼西亚的伦岛。原住民之间的内战和欧洲殖民者带来的疾病使得勒纳佩人的数量在1660年至1670年间大幅减少。至1770年，勒纳佩人的数量已经下降至200人。<br><br>

1702年，由于黄热病和鼠疫（黑死病），纽约有10万死去，失去了40%的人口。在1702至1800年间，纽约总共遭遇了七次黄热病的侵袭。<br><br>

18世纪初，作为贸易港的纽约在英国统治下逐渐兴旺。同时，纽约还成为了奴隶制的中心，1730年有42%的家庭拥有奴隶，在殖民地中仅次于南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿。。大部分奴隶主拥有家奴，另一部分则将他们送出做工。奴隶制成为了纽约经济的重要组成部分，大量奴隶万殖民时代的非裔人。<br><br>

爱尔兰大饥荒使大批爱尔兰移民涌入纽约，到1860年，四个纽约人中就有一个出生于爱尔兰（总共超过200,000人）。同时，德意志革命也使德国移民大量迁入，1860年另外四分之一的城市人口来自德国。<br><br>
民主党候选人在选举中屡屡获胜，纽约与美国南方也产生了紧密的联系。1861年市长费尔南多・伍德号召纽约跟随南方退出联邦，但他的这一号召最终没有成行。在南北战争期间，对于征兵法律的不满导致了1863年由爱尔兰裔工人阶级领导的纽约征兵暴动。<br><br>
移民与黑人长期存在竞争，由此暴动演化为对纽约黑人和其财产的攻击。暴动者将有色人种孤儿院烧毁，其中200名儿童幸得逃生。此外他们还杀死近100名黑人，攻击了更多，尤其是在港口区域。这是美国历史上最为惨重的骚乱之一。暴力活动导致许多黑人离开纽约前往威廉斯堡、布鲁克林和新泽西，至1865年，曼哈顿的黑人人口跌破10,000（1820年水平）。白人工人阶级由此取得统治地位。<br><br>
