A native of Providence, R.I., McNerney earned a B.A. degree from Yale University in 1971 and an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1975. He is married and has five children. He enjoys skiing, golf, hiking and hockey. In Yale, he obtained an undergraduate degree in American Studies.<br><br>
My sports were team sports, like ice hockey and baseball. The whole team dynamic is similar in business. Leadership is earned - the captain earns that role. Result and performance: first in, last out, judgment and fair. 先入、后出、知可否、均分。<br><br>
Sailing instructor, ranch 牧场 hand, and paperboy are a few of the early jobs held by Rhode Island native Jim McNerney. He's Irish, cautious and private, very selective about who he opens up to.<br><br>
The family has a vacation home in Bitterroot Valley, Mont. They like skiing, horseback riding and hiking.<br><br>
Jim McNerney loves playing and coaching ice hockey. As in sports, McNerney is "fearless" in his professional life, Dan McNerney says. "Of all of us, he has the high-energy temperament of our dad. It's like, 'Bring it on.' "<br><br>

McNerney, 64, oversees the strategic direction of the Chicago-based, $86.6 billion aerospace company.

Searle & Company, then attended Harvard Business School, receiving a Master of Business Administration in 1975.<br><br>

The Undergraduate Major in American Studies<br><br>
The undergraduate major encourages innovative, non-traditional scholarship; it also requires a substantial foundation of knowledge of the United States from local, national, and global perspectives. Additionally, each student chooses one of five areas of concentration: national formations; the international United States; material cultures and built environments; politics and American communities; and visual, audio, literary, and performance cultures.<br><br>

For more than 60 years, American Studies at Yale has promoted scholarship on the cultures and politics of the United States. We emphasize the interdisciplinary study of history and culture, national identity, and the construction of local, indigenous, borderland, and diasporic communities.<br><br>

American Studies offers a broad-ranging curriculum to introduce students to critical scholarship and methods from multiple disciplines.  The program has a national and international reputation for its faculty and graduates and its commitment to public humanities.<br><br>
Procter & Gamble -McKinsey<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">McNerney BIOGRAPHY</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>


1.0	BIOGRAPHY<br><br>

1.1	EARLY LIFE<br><br>
W. James (Jim) McNerney Jr. is the current CEO and Chairman of Boeing, a multi-billion dollar aerospace company.  He was born in 1949 in Providence, R.I to a father who was the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield Associations and a professor at the Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.  Under the influence of his father, he showed interest and talent in management at a young age. [1] <br><br>   
1.2	EDUCATION<br><br>
Throughout his high school career, he excelled academically while being extensively involved with extracurricular activities and sports.  For example, he was the president of Tri-Ship, a boys’ service club at his school, New Tier Township High School.  With the energy and vision he had, he put words into action and lead his team to take risks and carried out various initiatives [2].  After he graduated from high school, McNerney attended Yale University to get his B.A. degree in 1971.  Four years later, he received his M.B.A. from Harvard University.  <br><br>
1.3	CAREER PATH<br><br>
McNerney’s had a promising start in his career.  He worked for famous management development organizations in the world, such as Proctor & Gamble and McKinsey & Company.  Following graduation from Harvard University, he was immediately hired as the brand manager for Proctor & Gamble.  Three years later, he entered McKinsey & Company as a senior manager, where he had worked the next 4 years.  After the first 7 years, he entered GE Company in 1982 where he received extensive training from the former Chairman and CEO of GE Company, John F. Welch Jr., in management for the next 19 years.  During this period, he took 7 different managerial roles within the company: General Manager of GE Mobile Communications (1982-1988), President of GE Information Services (1988-1989), Executive Vice President GE Financial Services and GE Capital (1989-1991), President and CEO of GE Electrical Distribution and Control (1991-1992), President of GE Asia-Pacific (1993-1995), President of GE lighting (1995-1997), President and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines (1997-2000).  <br><br>
<a href= "link03.html">暗黑政治教材</a><br><br>
<a href= "link04.html">Lyndon B. Johnson</a><br><br>
After he succeeded in leading various teams in GE and being one of Welch’s elite protégé, he was rumoured to be the next Chairman and CEO of GE Company in 2001.  However, due to his age at the time, at 51 years old, he did not win the race to replace the retiring Welch.  Following this, he was immediately offered to become the Chairman and CEO of 3M, a multi-billion-dollar global technology company in electronics, telecommunications, industrial, consumer and office products, etc.  At the time, 3M was losing revenue and profits, so he took this challenge to reinvigorate the company and became the first outsider to act as its Chairman and CEO.  After his appointment, quarterly reports continued to improve throughout his term from 2001 to 2005. [3]  <br><br>
At the time of his appointment as the Chairman and CEO of 3M, he was also appointed to serve as a member on The Boeing Company Board.  As The Boeing Company faced sales and ethical troubles in the early 2000’s and the two predecessor CEOs were forced to resign, McNerney was rumoured to become the next Chairman and CEO due to the results he demonstrated at GE Company and 3M.    Although he didn’t show interest in taking the role at first, he later became the Chairman, President and CEO of The Boeing Company in 2005, again as an outsider. [3]<br><br>
1.4	OTHER ROLES AND ACHEIVEMENTS<br><br>
McNerney not only serves The Boeing Company, he is also plays other leadership roles in other industries, serving on different board committees as a director or a trustee.  These organizations include: Proctor & Gamble, International Business Machines Corp., Northwestern University, Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Board, The Field Museum Board of Trustees in Chicago, and IBM.  With his leadership achievements and contributions to the international aerospace industry, he was named the Executive of the Year by the National Management Association in 2008 and awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Cranfield University in 2009. [3]  <br><br>

As of  July of this year, he was appointed by U.S. President Barack Obama to co-chair the President’s Export Council, an advisory committee on international trade. [4]<br><br>
According to Forbes, he ranked 101st on the Forbes Executive Pay 2010.  Currently, he is earning a total compensation of roughly $19.43M, which is broken down into: $1.93M of salary, $3.14M of restricted stock awards, $1.00M of other compensation, $3.14M of option awards, $4.5M of non-equity incentive plan compensation, and $5.74M of change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings. [5] <br><br>
1.5	PERSONAL LIFE<br><br>
Although there is a lot of media revolving around his professional life and achievements, little is known about his personal life.  All that is known is that he is married twice with 5 children.  He has a love for sports, mainly in skiing, golf, hiking, hockey, and baseball, and that was college buddies with former President George W. Bush. [4]
2.0	RHETORICAL ANALYSIS<br><br>
What I find most striking about McNerney’s role as a leader is his modest image as a leader, his ability to quickly gain trust of the people of the organization, and the emphasis he puts on leadership development in his leadership style.  He recognizes the limitations of one person and the need for team-oriented strategies to bring results to company.  He understands that it is the people who drive the direction of a company and the need to unify them through consensus. McNerney is a leader who tries to grow the key staffers of an organization to produce results that will speak for itself and draw public’s attention, rather than pointing fingers at the public figures of the company.<br><br>
2.1	MODEST IMAGE AS A LEADER<br><br>
McNereney is a humble person who does not try to intimidate his subordinates and draw public’s attention.  He gives the impression that he is modest when he quietly stepped up to his position at 3M and Boeing.  His low-profile personal life demonstrates his desire to not draw media’s attention on himself.  Despite his connection with powerful figures mentioned in the biography, he does not try to abuse them.  He believes that “leadership is earned C the captain earns that role; it’s not because he’s the coach’s son.” [1]. To prove himself, he uses his strategies and skills to bring results to a company.  For example, when he first entered 3M, he saw that change needed to happen to boost its revenue and cut its costs.  He set the goal to increase sales and operating earnings of 3M by at least 10% annually, which was twice the rate 3M was growing in the past decade.   Rather than intimidating and ordering for change to happen, he effectively imposed this ambitious goal on the 3M employees instead.  As he says, “You can’t order change.  After all, there’s only one of me and 75,000 of them.” [6]  owever, despite his intensions to keep his modest image, some begged to differ.  GE insiders pointed out that he joined Boeing to get into politics. [6] Many questioned if he is trying to break free from his modest image and draw attention.  Yet after his appointment as the co-chair of the President’s Export Council, there was no exclusive media coverage about him, pointing to his continuance with a modest image.  Through this modest character of his, it has helped him win the hearts and minds of many people who run the daily operations of an organization.  <br><br>  
2.2	ABILITY TO GAIN TRUST QUICKLY<br><br>
McNerney is able to quickly gain trust of different organization’s employees, even though he was considered an outsider joining the companies.  For example, Boeing was facing a wide range of problems from suspicious business practice investigations to key staffers quitting and going on strike when he joined the company.  One of his first tasks was to make a seemingly impossible turnaround for this aerospace giant by resolving the conflict between the union and the company.  Using his listening skills, he heard out the concerns of the workers and tried to connect to them on a personal level.  Through the investigation into the core of the problem, he quickly gained trust of many of the Boeing employees.  This boasted the morale and working ethics of the company, creating a positive working environment as a whole.  However, despite his intensions to win the hearts of everyone, there were those who still didn’t buy his “offensive charms” and “pretty-boy resume”. [6] People criticized his ability to lead Boeing as it continued to prolong its already 3-year delayed delivery of Boeing 737. People doubted his skills because he lacked the technical knowledge needed in this business. [8] However, it should also be recognized that he has been learning on the job in the past 5 years in terms of the key technical details that need to be known.  During meetings, he has been able to link the product to a bigger picture while asking intelligent technical questions. [6]  It is hard to gain the trust of each and every person, but the personal connections he tries to make with the people brings him a step closer to his goal. The bond of trust he forms with many, outline the basis for his emphasis on leadership development, where people would be less reluctant to openly express and share their ideas.   <br><br>
2.3	EMPHASIS ON LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT <br><br>
McNerney is a leader who manages his people by putting emphasis on the leadership development of potential leaders.  As he states in an interview, “I start with people’s growth, my own growth included.” [1] These are the people who are willing to adapt and change under different conditions, and have the character of openness, courage, and teamwork.  He tries to get the people 15% better by removing bureaucratic obstacles that may keep them from “igniting” and set goals that stretch people beyond their comfort zones. [6]  His role is to facilitate inspiration on other rather than commanding them, which is very different from his mentor, John F. Welch Jr.    He tries to involve people when developing strategies, so that they will all agree upon, therefore be emotionally engaged in the concept and preserve to support and carry the strategy out.  In an interview with Fortune, he mentions that “if people who are running and participating in a company grow, then the company’s growth will in many respects take care of itself” [1].   Although he has limited technical background, he is able to ask the big questions and see the big picture.  He is able to guide the company to the right direction, and inspire growth while growing with them [1].    As he has mentioned in his interview, “to expect a lot and inspire people, to have the right values, to find a way and deliver results C these are pretty fundamental things.”  Expectations and inspiration come hand-in-hand to help people grow, which will ultimately grow the company. <br><br>

<a href= "link06.html">特立独行的“老干妈”</a><br><br>
3.0	CONCLUSION<br><br>
McNerney is a leader who tries to build and strengthen a company so that it would repute itself on the long-run.  He recognizes the need to build a strong team of talented people who will drive the direction of the company in the future.  Through his leadership skills and his modest image, it shows that he wants to draw people’s attention to the company through the results it brings and not on the people themselves.  One’s life span can only last for so long, but a company can last for generations and be passed down to our great-great-great-grand children, like an empire.  As our society become more capitalistic, one can argue that companies will soon be the core of driving the world, just like how the economy is determining our future.  Seeing this trend, McNerney’s leadership involvement in various sectors shows that he tries to not only build the company more solid, but also contribute to the greater good.  If companies are the key facilitators for future generations, then we should build companies that will be for the better on the long-run, learning from McNerney’s leadership style.<br><br>

McNerney：Help others get better. 政工/政委/Vujicic<br><br>
<a href= "link03.html">暗黑政治教材</a><br><br>
<a href= "link04.html">Lyndon B. Johnson</a><br><br>	

I start with people's growth, my own growth included. Help others get better, that is, help people who work for you grow. If team works, everything will be fine.<br><br>
My ability to lead (leiten/Leiter), to chart the course for the team members, to inspire them to reach for performance, to deliver the values you bring to the job. We focus on the courage to do the right thing. I tend to think about this in terms of helping others get better. I view myself as a value-added facilitator（促进者/帮助着）here more than as someone who's crashing through the waves on the bridge of a frigate护卫舰. It feels great to see the people you work with grow and achieve.<br><br>
It generally gets down to a very personal level - openness to change, courage to change, hard work and teamwork. What I do is figure out how to unlock that in people, because most people have that inside them. But they often get trapped in, for example, fear, bureaucracy or confusion.<br><br>
You chart the course for yourself and the people you work with, to expect a lot and inspire people, to have the right values, to find a way and deliver results - these are pretty fundamental things. The things you expect of people have to be so fundamental. Like a priest missionary (the seminary, The Communication Department （传理系/“仁”即“沟通”/仁者无敌） of Hong Kong Baptist University). I expect a fair amount from people. It makes them so much better. <br><br>
There was no question that there was an expectation in my family, for every member, including my children. I think some of the saddest things in the world are when you don't expect enough from your children. They have to run a higher standard. Yes, it will be a little over focused, a little tough, but that's part of the package or side effects (副作用).
As a child, you're trying to grow and meet expectations. If you focus and insist, you will win at least once. Success and achievement can feed on themselves. It feels good to keep succeeding. It’s positive feedback. Then you have the passion to win. Like addiction or maniac （上瘾/狂热）. <br><br>
Expect a lot, inspire people, ask them to take the values that are important to them at home or at church and bring them to work. <br><br>

How one CEO learned to fly - McNerney<br><br>
Boeing chief James McNerney has now made his mark at three major companies. How? "Help others get better," he says.
FORTUNE Magazine<br><br>
By Geoffrey Colvin, senior editor-at-large<br><br>
October 16 2006 <br><br>

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- It's tough to find an executive who has delivered top performance across as wide a swath 条块 of business as Boeing  CEO W. James McNerney. In a 19-year career at General Electric , he ran GE's Asian operations, its light bulb business and its jet engine business, among others - performing so well that he was a finalist to succeed CEO Jack Welch in late 2000. When he didn't get that job, 3M recruited him almost instantly to be CEO; the stock rose 34 percent on his watch. He left 3M to become Boeing's chief in mid-2005, and since then the stock is up 30 percent.
<br><br>
McNerney, 57, spoke recently with Fortune's Geoffrey Colvin about the importance of his father and Jack Welch, how he helps people who work for him grow, why he admires Steve Jobs and much else.<br><br>

Most people in business and other fields develop for a while and then stop, but a small minority keep getting better for years. Are you conscious of continually trying to develop and improve?<br><br>
I start with people's growth<br><br>
I start with people's growth, my own growth included. I don't start with the company's strategy or products. I start with people's growth because I believe that if the people who are running and participating in a company grow, then the company's growth will in many respects take care of itself.<br><br>
I view myself as a value-added facilitator<br><br>
I have this idea in my mind - all of us get 15 percent better every year. Usually that means your ability to lead (leiten/Leiter), and that's all about your ability to chart the course for [your employees], to inspire them to reach for performance - the values you bring to the job, with a focus on the courage to do the right thing. I tend to think about this in terms of helping others get better. I view myself as a value-added facilitator here more than as someone who's crashing through the waves on the bridge of a frigate护卫舰.<br><br>

##<br><br>

Can you tell in advance/Lyndon Johnson<br><br>
What have you observed about those who grow and those who don't? Can you tell in advance who they'll be?<br><br>

No, you can't always tell in advance. It generally gets down to a very personal level - openness to change, courage to change, hard work, teamwork. What I do is figure out how to unlock that in people, because most people have that inside them. But they [often] get trapped in a bureaucratic environment where they've been beaten about the head and shoulders. That makes their job narrower and narrower, so they're no longer connected to the company's mission - they're a cog 钝齿 in some manager's machine.<br><br>

Do you come across people who think there are some abilities they just don't have in them - think they're simply not constituted to do certain things?<br><br>
The things you expect of people have to be so fundamental<br><br>
That's a question I think about a lot. Where I've finally landed on that issue is this: The things you expect of people have to be so fundamental that they're independent of people's style, culture ... their function.<br><br>

So when we talk about the ability to chart the course for yourself and the people you work with, to expect a lot and inspire people, to have the right values, to find a way and deliver results - these are pretty fundamental things. Whether you're an individual contributor in a lab in a far-off place or leading thousands of people in a major services organization, they all apply. And they're compatible with an individual's personality and background.<br><br>
Procter & Gamble, McKinsey and GE<br><br>
Before 3M and Boeing, you worked at three of the most famous management-development organizations in the world - Procter & Gamble, McKinsey and GE. Were you trying to put together experiences that would complement 补充 one another and make you a more complete business person?<br><br>

I was conscious of it. I was fortunate to grow up at GE, where that automatically happens to people who are doing well. But if it had not happened to me, I would have raised my hand - because you do need to see more than one thing. It increases your ability to analogize 类推 when you see different situations, increases your self-confidence, your situational awareness.<br><br>

What experiences from your past were most important in your development?<br><br>
tough and inspirational<br><br>
Being GE's Asia leader. I saw the company from the outside in. Jack [Welch] gave me no blueprint, just said, "Asia is the biggest opportunity we've got, and we're not doing much - go figure it out." Tremendously valuable. Another thing I would cite is just working for Welch. He was a hell 了不起的 of a leader - both tough and inspirational. The 3M experience was also a great experience - a group of great people who needed a rejuvenation 回春. A pure leadership challenge.<br><br>

Besides Welch, which people were most important in your development?<br><br>
fearlessness about change, fun with change<br><br>
I was lucky to have a great dad. He was a professor and a business leader [CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield Associations], and he had the Welch characteristic - fearlessness about change, fun with change.<br><br>

I tend to be inspired by pieces of people. Look at Steve Jobs and his ability to commercialize innovation. That was the struggle at 3M - there's lots of innovation at the company, but how is it commercialized sustainably? That guy is the best I've known at that, and I have enormous respect for his ability to commercialize innovation.<br><br>

Research finds that great performers in any field tended to receive a lot of early encouragement from their parents.<br><br>
I expect a fair amount from people. It makes them so much better<br><br>
There was no question that in our house doing well, doing it the right way, school, sports - there was an expectation. One of the things I've taken away from that is that I'm unafraid to expect a fair amount from people. It makes them so much better - you're doing them a disservice if you don't.<br><br>

I think some of the saddest things in the world are when you don't expect enough from your children. All of sudden they're 21, and they have lower standards than if you'd taken a tougher, higher, bumpier road with them. I pulled that from my father. It probably made me, as my wife tells me, a little overfocused, a little insensitive, a little too goal-oriented, but that's part of the package.<br><br>
My sports were team sports<br><br>
People often draw parallels between sports and other fields. You were enthusiastic about sports - do you see those parallels?<br><br>

No question, though it's almost trite 老套 to say it these days. My sports were team sports, ice hockey and baseball. The whole team dynamic is similar in business. Leadership is earned - the captain earns that role; it's not because he's the coach's son. These are all things we know, but in today's world it's not a bad idea to remind ourselves. When companies lose their way, they lose their way on these fundamental issues of leadership.<br><br>

Continually pushing oneself to improve is difficult and even painful, and it's largely a mystery why some people do it and others don't. Have you developed any views about that?<br><br>

[Long pause.] That is such a great question. I do know that there's a restlessness in some people. Go back to Welch. What happened yesterday didn't matter. What happens tomorrow is the only thing that matters, and that's an everyday occurrence.<br><br>
Success and achievement can feed on themselves<br><br>
I don't know if it comes from the toilet training, if your parents do expect a lot of you and you're always restlessly trying to grow and meet their expectations. That's a component. Another is that success and achievement can feed on themselves. It feels good to keep succeeding. It feels great to see the people you work with grow and achieve.<br><br>

Maybe the ignition 点火 happens when you're younger, and then it feeds on itself. The next question is how you give it to people who weren't fortunate enough to have it given to them when they were young. It gets back to leadership attributes - expect a lot, inspire people, ask them to take the values that are important to them at home or at church and bring them to work.<br><br>

Do those personal issues apply to a whole company?<br><br>

Yes, institutionally, the ability to be agile 灵活 enough is the gut issue in leading an organization today. You need a clear-eyed view of what's really happening in your marketplace and with your competition, of what you're really good at and not good at, which has probably changed over the past ten years. How you lead people in a way that makes them feel good about that, because it means job dislocation 混乱 - that's the gut issue. If you can develop a team with the personal characteristics we talked about, how does that get institutionalized? That's the leadership challenge we're wrestling with at Boeing, and we're bound and determined to get it right.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">波音CEO的成长</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
2006年12月31日 <br><br>
波音公司 CEO 詹姆斯 麦克纳尼对三家大公司都产生了深远的影响。他是如何做到这一点的呢？他的答案是: 帮别人做得更好
<br><br>
　　很难找倒像波音公司（Boeing）首席执行官詹姆斯 麦克纳尼（W. James McNerney）那样的人，在多个行业都成为表现杰出的管理者。<br><br>

他在通用电气公司干了 19 年，负责亚洲业务、灯泡业务、喷气发动机业务，等等，业绩非常出色，所以在 2000 年底成为接任前首席执行官杰克 韦尔奇（Jack Welch）的最终候选人之一。在他落选后，3M 公司几乎立刻将他招至旗下，聘为首席执行官。在他的管理下，3M 公司的股票价格上涨了 34%。2005 年年中，他离开 3M 公司，出任波音公司 CEO。自那以后，波音股票价格上升了 30%。57 岁的麦克纳尼最近接受了《财富》杂志的杰弗里 科尔文（Geoffrey Colvin）的采访，谈到了他父亲和杰克　韦尔奇对他的重要影响、他怎样帮助员工成长、他欣赏史蒂夫 乔布斯（Steve Jobs）的原因等等话题。
<br><br>

<a href= "link01.html">GE 的 继承人选们</a><br><br>
<a href= "link02.html">劳资关系：Give peace a chance</a><br><br>

　　在商界和其他领域，大部分人都在发展了一段时间后就停滞不前，但少数人却能够保持长期持续的发展。你是不是有意识地在努力不断发展和提高？<br><br>

　　我先谈谈人的成长，包括我个人的成长，而不是说公司的战略或产品。我之所这样说，是因为我相信，如果管理和参与公司成长的人成长了，那么从很多方面来说，公司就会自动成长。我头脑里有这样一种想法: 我们每个人每年都要提高 15%。这通常意味著你要有领导能力，也就是指（为你的员工）规划路线、激励他们做出业绩的能力──这是你对这个岗位的价值，核心是要有勇气去做该做的事情。我倾向于从帮助他人成长的角度考虑这个问题。我认为自己是价值增值的推动者，而不是亲自指挥军舰乘风破浪。
<br><br>
　　你对那些能够成长和不能成长的人有什么评价？你能事先发现哪些员工属于哪一类吗？
<br><br>
　　不，不是总能事先发现。通常，这取决于非常个人层次的因素──接受变化，勇于变化，工作努力，善于协作。我所做的就是发现如何释放人们的这些品质，因为大部分人都有这些内在素质。但是，他们（经常）被束缚在一种枪打出头鸟的官僚主义的环境里，这使他们的职责越来越狭窄，结果离公司的使命越来越远──最后成了某些经理的机器上的零件。
<br><br>
　　你有没有碰到过觉得自己完全缺乏某些能力的人──觉得自己根本没办法为某些事情做出贡献？
<br><br>
　　这个问题我也想过很多次。我最终对这个问题的定位是: 你对人们的期待必须是很基本的，并且这些期望与人们的风格、文化以及他们的职能无关。所以，当我们讨论为我们自己和我们的员工制定路线的能力、提出高期望和激励员工的能力、树立适当的价值观的能力、发现方法和做出成绩的能力等，指的都是非常基本的能力。无论你是一个偏远的实验室中的实验员，还是在一个大型服务组织里领导著上千人的领导，都需要这些能力。而且，任何性格和背景的人都可以具备这些能力。
<br><br>
　　进入3M公司和波音公司之前，你曾在宝洁（Procter & Gamble）、麦肯锡（McKinsey）和通用电气（GE）这三家在管理发展领域举世闻名的组织工作。你是不是尝试整合各种互补的经验，使自己成为一个更全面的商业人士？
<br><br>
　　我意识到了这一点。我很幸运能在通用电气公司成长，在通用电气，只要干得好，就自然能做到这一点。但是，如果没有发生这种情况，我会主动提出要求，因为我需要拓宽视界。这会增强你遇到不同情况时触类旁通的能力，提高你的自信和审时度势能力。
<br><br>
　　你过去的哪些经验对你的发展最重要？
<br><br>
　　做通用电气的亚洲区总裁的经验最重要。我可以从一个局外人的角度观察公司。杰克（韦尔奇）没有给我任何蓝图，只是对我说: “亚洲是我们拥有的最大机遇，但我们还没有什么成就──去看看应该怎么办。”这段经历非常有价值。另一次很重要的经验，就是做韦尔奇的下属。他是一位相当出色的领导者，意志坚决，又富有灵感。在 3M 公司的经验也很重要，那里有一群需要创新的杰出人才组成的团队。那对领导能力绝对是一种挑战。
<br><br>
　　除了韦尔奇之外，还有谁对你的发展最为重要？
<br><br>
　　我很幸运，有一位伟大的父亲。他是位教授，同时又是企业领导者（是 Blue Cross Blue Shield 公司的首席执行官）。他也有韦尔奇的特点，不怕变化，并且乐在其中。我往往受到一些人的启发。比如说史蒂夫　乔布斯，还有他将创新商业化的能力。那正是 3M 公司不断为之奋斗的事情──公司里有很多创新，但怎样把创新持续地商业化呢？这个家伙是我认识的人中在这方面做得最好的。对于他将创新商业化的能力，我钦佩之至。
<br><br>
The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) is a federation of 37 separate health insurance organizations and companies in the United States. Combined, they directly or indirectly provide health insurance to over 100 million Americans.[3] The history of Blue Cross dates back to 1929, while the history of Blue Shield dates to 1939.
<br><br>

<a href= "link04.html">Lyndon B. Johnson</a><br><br>

　　研究发现，所有领域的杰出人才往往在小时候就从父母那里得到很多鼓励。
<br><br>
　　毫无疑问，在我的家庭，父母对我们有一种期望，在功课、运动方面要做得出色，举止得当。我从这种期望中得到的东西是，我不怕对人们有适当的期望。这会帮他们做得更好；如果你对他们没有适当的期望，就是在伤害他们。我认为，世界上最悲哀的事情就是父母对子女的期望过低。突然间，他们到了 21 岁，表现并不出色。如果当时你对他们要求更苛刻，期望更高，他们会更优秀。我从父亲身上得出了这个结论。正像我妻子跟我说的那样，这可能让我变得有点过分集中精力，有点感情麻木，有点过分以目标为导向。但是，这都是伴随高期望而来的副产品。
<br><br>
　　人们经常用体育与其他领域进行类比。你很热爱运动──你觉得这种类比正确吗？<br><br>
领导地位是争取来的──队长是靠实力得到这个位置的，并不是因为他是教练的儿子。<br><br>
　　完全正确，虽然现在这样说已经很老套了。我参与的都是团体运动，冰球和棒球。整个团队的动态和企业很相似。领导地位是争取来的──队长是靠实力得到这个位置的，并不是因为他是教练的儿子。这些道理我们都知道，但在今天的世界，不断提醒自己，这不是个坏主意。公司迷失方向的时候，主要是弄不清这些基本的领导问题。<br><br>

　　不断强迫自己改进是很困难的，甚至是很痛苦的。为什么有些人能做到，有些人做不到，这基本上是个谜。你对此有什么见解吗？
<br><br>
　　（长时间的沉默。）这个问题很好。我知道有些人生来就不安于现状。再说说韦尔奇。昨天发生了什么并不重要，明天会发生什么才是唯一重要的事情，每天都是如此。我不知道是不是从小训练自己上厕所时就开始了，如果你的父母对你有很高的期望，你就会不断成长来满足他们的期望。这是一点。另一点是，成功和成就可以带来更多的成功和成就。一直成功让人感觉很好，看到与自己共事的人取得进步和成就也让人感觉很棒。也许当你年轻的时候，得到了这个火种，然后火种会自己变大。接下来的问题就是，你如何把这个火种传递给没那么幸运、年轻的时候没有得到火种的人。这又回到了领导特征的问题上──提出高期望，激励员工，让他们树立起对他们的生活和宗教信仰重要的价值观，并把这些价值观带到工作岗位上来。<br><br>

　　那些有关个人的结论也适用于整个公司吗？<br><br>

是的，从制度上看，机敏通常是今天领导一个组织的关键。你必须对市场动向、竞争状况、优势劣势以及过去十年可能发生的变化有一个清醒的认识。关键在于，你如何用一种员工喜欢的方式领导他们。做不到这点，工作上就会出现混乱。如果你可以建立一个拥有我们谈到的那些个人特征的团队，怎么把这些特征体制化呢？这就是我们在波音公司面临的领导挑战，我们一定会解决这个问题，我们有这个决心。（《财富》杂志，作者: Geoffrey Colvin，译者: 廉晓红）

Boeing versus Airbus（John Newhouse）<br><br>	
Updated 2/26/200<br><br>

By Marilyn Adams, USA TODAY<br><br>

CHICAGO ― A year ago, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney had spent several months at the helm 掌权 of a company reeling 卷起来 from federal corruption probes and the resignations of two embattled predecessors.
<br><br>
With McNerney's OK, then-general-counsel Doug Bain opened a PowerPoint presentation to a 2006 meeting of top Boeing (BA) executives with a tough wake-up call: the federal prisoner numbers of former Boeing CFO Michael Sears and former Air Force weapons buyer Darleen Druyun, whom Sears recruited to Boeing in exchange for favorable treatment.
<br><br>
"These are not ZIP codes," Bain recalls telling the crowd. "Jim came out from the very beginning saying ethics is a core value. He's saying the same thing every day."<br><br>
## Boeing CEO Jim McNerney got lessons in values at an early age. Ethics "was in our upbringing家教," a brother says.
##<br><br>

<a href= "link03.html">暗黑政治教材</a><br><br>
<a href= "link04.html">Lyndon B. Johnson</a><br><br>

After 20 months as CEO, McNerney is still getting noticed most for keeping the aerospace giant, No. 26 on the Fortune 500, on the straight and narrow. All the while, McNerney has presided over soaring sales and a 43% rise in Boeing's share price. Chicago-based Boeing is the world's top-selling builder of passenger jets, and second-biggest defense contractor behind Lockheed Martin.<br><br>

Boeing was in a steep dive when McNerney took control in July 2005.
<br><br>
Former CEO Phil Condit, a visionary aerospace engineer known for living large, was forced out in the wake of defense procurement scandals that landed Druyun and Sears in prison. McNerney's short-time predecessor, Harry Stonecipher, also charged by Boeing directors with restoring Boeing's integrity, was forced out after sending explicitly sexual e-mails to a Boeing executive with whom he was having an extramarital affair.
<br><br>
McNerney, 57, represents a stark 完全的 contrast to his predecessors by several measures. He's the first Boeing CEO from outside the company since World War II. In person, he comes across as low-key and proper.
<br><br>
In stints 天资 at General Electric and 3M, McNerney established himself in the nation's top tier of executive talent, the place where the largest corporations look first for their executive leadership.
<br><br>
"We wanted a change agent, someone who could communicate a commitment to ethics," says Boeing lead director Kenneth Duberstein, who once served as President Reagan's chief of staff. "Jim is the whole package: strong leader, visionary, motivator, team builder. He's very comfortable in his own skin."
<br><br>
McNerney is the product of Ivy League schools and decades of rigorous business discipline, mainly at GE, where he was a finalist to succeed former CEO Jack Welch.
<br><br>
"I'm a business guy," McNerney said almost apologetically 抱歉 in an interview at Chicago headquarters.
<br><br>
He confesses to being an aviation geek: "I love this industry: big technology, big customers," he says. "It's a cool thing to be around."
<br><br>
But he seems to possess something valuable that his predecessors lacked: an internal compass 罗盘/界限 that guides him safely around corporate and political land mines.
<br><br>
At Boeing, whose business with the Pentagon and governments around the world relies heavily on its reputation, McNerney's gut instinct about what's right ― and what looks right ― seems to be working.
<br><br>
Boeing has scored important Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security contracts in recent months. The rehabilitation 修复 of its battered 磨损 image seems well underway. His central message to Boeing's 153,000 employees: "We'd rather have you not deliver what you have promised … than cut corners 抄近路. I have to be willing to take a hit businesswise if it's the right thing to do."
<br><br>
Last year, following a three-year federal investigation into its defense procurement missteps, Boeing did take a hit. It agreed to pay the Air Force $615 million to settle the investigation, the largest penalty ever for a defense contractor.
<br><br>
The settlement allowed Boeing to avoid criminal charges over allegations 指控 it improperly acquired internal documents from rival defense contractor Lockheed Martin and illegally hired an Air Force official who was overseeing Boeing contracts ― all in a quest to win defense contracts.
<br><br>
Led by McNerney and a few others, Boeing decided to forgo a tax exemption on the settlement that might have saved the company $200 million. Although some at Boeing argued for taking the deduction, McNerney and his close advisers disagreed.
<br><br>
Boeing announced the decision days before McNerney appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee to answer for Boeing's lapses. The day he testified, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Boeing's sharpest critic during the scandals, made a point of praising "the integrity of the new management team."
<br><br>
Board member Duberstein, now a Washington, D.C., consultant, says the decision to forgo 放弃the deduction was a home run 本垒打.
<br><br>
"I think that changed the whole tenor 进程 of the conversation about Boeing," he says. "Jim is much more politically gifted than he gives himself credit for."
<br><br>
Midwestern roots
<br><br>
McNerney grew up around business and policy. He is the eldest of five children of Shirley and Walter James McNerney of Winnetka, Ill., an affluent Chicago suburb.
<br><br>
The senior McNerney, who died at age 80 in the same month his son took over Boeing, was himself a businessman of national repute. He oversaw the integration of Blue Cross and Blue Shield and, in the 1960s, helped shape the congressional debate leading to Medicare and Medicaid, the programs that provide health insurance to poor and elderly Americans.
<br><br>
Of the five children, four, including Jim McNerney, earned MBAs; the fifth, Dan McNerney, is a minister and an executive of Presbyterian Frontier Fellowship, a missionary organization based in Minnesota.
<br><br>
At home, "management was in the water," says Dan McNerney. Their father, "a fun, gregarious 合群 Irishman," set high expectations for his kids. But he also encouraged public service and discouraged self-promotion. The family was active in the local Presbyterian church.
<br><br>
"Ethics wasn't something Jim had to study," he said. "It was in our upbringing." Methoddist<br><br>

To this day, he says, "Jim doesn't want to be the center of attention. He's cautious and private, very selective about who he opens up to."<br><br>

Boeing declined 谢绝 USA TODAY's request to interview Jim McNerney's wife. As for outside interests, "it's either work or kids," he says.<br><br>

The family has a vacation home in Bitterroot Valley, Mont. They like skiing, horseback riding and hiking.<br><br>

Jim McNerney loves playing and coaching ice hockey. As in sports, McNerney is "fearless" in his professional life, Dan McNerney says. "Of all of us, he has the high-energy temperament of our dad. It's like, 'Bring it on.' "<br><br>

Up the ranks
<br><br>
After a Harvard MBA and stints with Procter & Gamble and consultant McKinsey & Co., in 1982 McNerney joined GE, where Welch had just become CEO.<br><br>

For the next 19 years, McNerney rose through the executive ranks, ultimately becoming one of three candidates to succeed Welch. In his book Jack: Straight from the Gut, Welch says GE threw test after test at candidates McNerney, Robert Nardelli and Jeffrey Immelt.<br><br>

McNerney was dispatched to Asia in 1992 to become president of operations there. Shortly afterward, GE named him CEO of its lighting business. Two years later, he was CEO of GE aircraft engines.
<br><br>
"I sent him to China with a suitcase and not much else," Welch recalled in an interview. GE's business in China was "negligible 微不足道 when he went there," Welsh said. McNerney's assignment was to figure out how to grow it.
<br><br>
McNerney succeeded, Welch said, by attracting "a lot of GE talent" on the strength of his personality. He also assembled an advisory group of talented Chinese and Southeast Asian leaders who gave GE valuable business contacts.
<br><br>
"He took a big risk going there, starting from scratch," Welch said.
<br><br>
It was in Asia, with its demand for passenger planes, that McNerney first learned about the business of jet engines. During the three years he led GE's jet engines business, it contributed more profit to the corporation than any other of its 20 business units.<br><br>

On his watch, Boeing chose the GE-90 jet engine to power its popular 777 long-range jetliner, a big win for GE. In 2001, McNerney was invited to join Boeing's board of directors, the role that eventually propelled him to the top of Boeing.
<br><br>
It was during McNerney's corporate climb that his first marriage failed.
<br><br>
Perhaps the couple's deepest hurt was the fate of their older child, Christy, now 29, who suffered neurological damage and is permanently disabled. She is institutionalized in Chicago.
<br><br>
McNerney met his second wife, Haity, at GE, where she was helping the company set up a fitness program. They have three children, ages 13, 15 and 18, and live in Chicago's northern suburbs, not far from where he grew up.
<br><br>
Despite years of standout performance at GE, McNerney was not to reach the top there. Welch in 2000 tapped Immelt, who had run GE's medical systems business, to become GE's next CEO.
<br><br>
Welch has never publicly explained why. McNerney calls it the biggest disappointment of his career, but the two men have remained friends.
<br><br>
"He was a major, major influence on my life, both personally and professionally," McNerney says. Immelt remains CEO at GE, and Nardelli recently resigned the top job at Home Depot.
<br><br>
Soon after Welch's decision, 3M recruited McNerney as its CEO. There, he restructured operations, cutting thousands of jobs, and reduced costs and manufacturing defects. 3M's share price rose 34% during his tenure. After he was there four years, Boeing persuaded McNerney to move from its boardroom to the CEO's office.
<br><br>
Labor relations
<br><br>
Earlier this month, McNerney did something unexpected. He picked up the phone, called the chief of Boeing's biggest and most outspoken labor union, and extended an olive branch.
<br><br>
Tom Buffenbarger, top boss of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, was surprised. In summer 2005, right after McNerney took over as CEO, 19,000 IAM members struck 罢工 Boeing for a month. The relationship had been strained since.
<br><br>
In December, after his first meeting with McNerney, Buffenbarger described the CEO as "an aloof 冷淡 kind of guy."
<br><br>
Now, labor-supported Democrats control both houses of Congress. According to Buffenbarger, McNerney told him on the phone this month that Boeing and the union should mend 修补 their relationship and work together on matters of mutual interest.
<br><br>
"I think he's a realist and a pragmatist," Buffenbarger says today.
<br><br>
One mutual interest is Boeing's upcoming bid for a $20 billion-plus Air Force contract for aerial refueling tanker jets, a project derailed years ago by Boeing's misconduct.
<br><br>
If Boeing wins, the project will mean many jobs building Boeing 767s for the Air Force. McNerney knows that any ethical breach 破坏 now could threaten Boeing's chances, and its future.
<br><br>
"You have to fight it every day, whether you've had corruption or not, because you're a company of human beings," McNerney says. "The temptation to cut corners 抄近路 is always there."

CHICAGO―The cutting-edge jetliners Boeing Co. BA had bet its future on sat grounded, unsettling images of passengers on escape chutes 降落伞 splashed across TV, when Chief Executive Jim McNerney sent handwritten apologies to the chairmen of the airlines whose 787 Dreamliner batteries went up in smoke.<br><br>

Around the same time last month, he discreetly 小心 persuaded the CEOs of General Motors GM and General Electric GE to lend Boeing their best electrical experts, and quietly met with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration.<br><br>

With his storied company facing the biggest crisis of his eight-year tenure, Mr. McNerney is wagering 保证/赌注 that it is better to disappear behind the scenes 在后台 to try to fix the problem than to be out front reassuring the public.<br><br>

"I'm the one who has to stand up with absolute confidence when Boeing proposes a solution to enable this technology for the world," he said during an exclusive interview in his Chicago office. "And the only way I know how is to dive in deeply with the people doing the scientific and technical work."<br><br>

The company is expected to submit a proposal to the FAA on Friday seeking approval for fixes that Boeing hopes will return the planes to the skies, and plans to meet with Japanese air-safety authorities next week. The proposal sets an ambitious timetable calling for passenger flights to resume as early as mid-March.<br><br>

The stakes couldn't be higher.<br><br>

"This airplane is our near- and medium-term future, and ultimately speaks to our reputation and our brand," Mr. McNerney said during one of two interviews in which he detailed what he and his senior executives have been doing since the crisis erupted. His desk was covered with detailed drawings of Dreamliner systems, which he turned facedown.<br><br>

Boeing continues to build five 787s per month, even though it can't deliver or get fully paid for any of the planes―which list for about $200 million―until the Dreamliner is recertified to fly. In a meeting Wednesday at the Everett, Wash., assembly plant, Mr. McNerney told his senior executives: "We'll have a lot of 787s stacking up around here if we don't get this done sooner rather than later."<br><br>

At the same time, Boeing's airline customers, who have been forced to cancel hundreds of flights, are increasing the pressure on the chief executive to detail plans to bring their Dreamliners back into service.<br><br>

The lithium-ion-battery meltdowns have been a public-relations debacle 崩溃 for the company. Two 787s started smoking, and passengers on one of them escaped on emergency slides after landing in Japan. Airline-safety officials in the U.S. and Japan displayed burned-up lithium-ion batteries and regulators world-wide grounded the entire fleet. It was the FAA's first jetliner grounding since 1979.<br><br>

Mr. McNerney has taken some flak 争吵 for not doing more to inform investors and the public what he has been doing to solve the problem. "He's not been front and center when there's a lot of fear that this battery problem could be more than a minor glitch 过失," said aviation consultant Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Teal Group. "When you launch only one new jet a decade, you need someone in the public eye taking personal control, rather than raising more questions about how long until the 787 planes will fly."<br><br>

Boeing's board has been supportive of its CEO's approach. "Jim is doing exactly what he should be doing," said lead director Kenneth Duberstein. "He is out front right now with the constituencies that matter―the customers, the regulators, the employees and the suppliers."<br><br>

Mr. McNerney, who is 63 years old, came to Boeing in 2005 after running 3M Co. He was raised in a family of five children, and his father was CEO of Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Mr. McNerney had been a varsity 大学代表队 pitcher at Yale University and fraternity 兄弟会 brother of former President George W. Bush. After earning a Harvard M.B.A., he worked in marketing at Procter & Gamble PG and management consulting at McKinsey & Co., then moved up the ranks at General Electric, where he ran several divisions, including one that built airplane engines. After losing the horse race to succeed Jack Welch as GE's chief executive, he moved to 3M and became a Boeing director.<br><br>


When Boeing brought him in as chief executive, it was reeling from corruption probes, the loss of defense contracts, weakness in its commercial-jet business and the resignation of two consecutive CEOs. The defense business represented half of Boeing's revenue. To build the airliner business, Mr. McNerney pushed the development of the 787 Dreamliner. It was designed to be a game-changing passenger jet―more fuel-efficient than competitors, with a lightweight frame made of composite materials and an electrical system using powerful lithium-ion batteries.<br><br>

Orders poured in, and last year Boeing surpassed Europe's Airbus as the leading aircraft manufacturer in the world by number of planes ordered and delivered―the first time it held the top spot in a decade.<br><br>

The Dreamliner was plagued with delays, which Boeing chalked 归因于 up to design changes and production outsourcing. Nevertheless, Mr. McNerney presided over a DreamTour last spring, including a black-tie gala 庆祝 at Reagan National Airport in Washington. By early January, 50 planes had been delivered.<br><br>

"I was beginning to feel better," Mr. McNerney recalled. "And then―bang 猛击."<br><br>

On Jan. 7, Mr. McNerney was told to turn on the television in his office. He saw a Dreamliner owned by Japan Airlines at the gate at Boston's Logan Airport. Smoke was coming out of the cargo area and firefighters were rushing to the empty plane. He got on the phone with Ray Conner, his commercial-airplane head, and chief technology officer John Tracy. They suspected "foreign object debris" or the 787's electrical panels, which had experienced two in-flight incidents in December.<br><br>

The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators. When Boeing's engineers were allowed aboard the next day, they saw firsthand that the fire was limited to the lithium-ion-battery unit.电池<br><br>

Mr. McNerney said he was surprised: "We had tested the hell out of" the battery, he said.<br><br>

Mr. McNerney spearheaded the company's probe, but other executives spoke publicly. The Dreamliner's chief engineer, Mike Sinnett, held conference calls with analysts, investors and the media. Mr. Conner attended a news conference with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and FAA chief Michael Huerta announcing a joint review of the 787 systems by the agency and Boeing. Mr. McNerney issued a statement pledging company support and cooperation, adding that Boeing stands "100% behind the integrity of the 787."<br><br>

Over the next week, Mr. McNerney and his team reviewed the prior battery testing. The batteries, each with eight cells, had shown no problems over 2.2 million cell-hours of operation, both on the ground and during 50,000 flight hours. The team devised a plan to assess the electrical system. Mr. McNerney set up a private meeting to brief the FAA chief. Separately, Mr. McNerney spoke to board members and customers.<br><br>
系统工程<br><br>
On Jan. 15, Mr. McNerney got home at 6:30 p.m., set out some fish he planned to bake and changed into workout clothes. Suddenly, his cellphone started vibrating with a string of messages: "Another battery fire." "Smell in cockpit." "Smoke in electric bay." "Plane diverted 转移 in Japan."<br><br>

He called Mr. Conner and told him: "The battery problem isn't a one-off anymore."<br><br>

The fish stayed uncooked as he worked the phones and watched news reports of All Nippon Airways passengers descending slides after an emergency landing in western Japan.<br><br>

The following day, Mr. McNerney slipped into Mr. Huerta's FAA office, unnoticed by journalists. The meeting swiftly turned grim as it became clear the FAA likely would halt all 787 flights.<br><br>
停飞
In Chicago the next day, Mr. Tracy, the chief technology officer, told Mr. McNerney that "nothing that happened posed a risk to the plane or the passengers," according to both men.<br><br>

Mr. McNerney banged his hands on his desk. "Do you understand the meaning of what we're dealing with here?" he recalled saying. The issue isn't just "electrochemistry in a battery…It's about the safety and confidence in our planes and our brand. And it can't happen again."<br><br>
寻求资源<br><br>
Mr. McNerney called his counterparts at GE, GM and other companies to ask for help from their top battery and electrical experts. "I wanted to make sure the world's technical experts were focused on this problem with us, because ultimately the credibility of our solution will depend not only on us," but would need their "imprimatur 许可," he said recently.<br><br>

He recalled telling one of his daughters he couldn't attend her horse show because "this is a tough problem for Dad right now." An avid 热心 ice-hockey player, he skipped his team's trip to Minneapolis for the annual pond-hockey national championship.<br><br>

On Jan. 25, he traveled to Washington for the annual formal dinner of the Alfalfa Club, a group of political and business leaders. Mr. McNerney, head of the Business Roundtable, a group of top CEOs, told various attendees that Boeing was working hard to solve the problem.<br><br>

He faced investors and analysts on a Jan. 30 conference call to discuss fourth-quarter financial results. He told them the operating performance was strong and that Boeing was moving to increase 787 production to 10 per month, from five, and to develop two more Dreamliner versions. He deflected 偏离 questions about the potential fallout 余波 of the battery problems, saying: "I can't predict the outcome, and I'm not going to. We're in the middle of an investigation."<br><br>

Some listeners weren't satisfied. "Investors weren't looking for him to reveal the details of investigation, but were certainly looking for a discussion of the what-if's," said Carter Leake, aerospace analyst for BB&T Capital Markets. "Investors were left twisting in the wind without any visibility to the timing or cost of the ultimate fix."<br><br>

A Boeing spokesman said that its guidance assumed no impact from the 787 groundings and that it would update investors "as necessary." Boeing's share price has held fairly steady through the crisis, closing Thursday at $76.01 in New York Stock Exchange trading.<br><br>

As the crisis dragged into its third week, Mr. McNerney flew to Seattle to check on progress at Boeing's commercial-aircraft unit. At his hotel suite on Feb. 4, he recalled, he grilled his team for three hours, pressing for "high analytical probabilities" on the likely cause and for "multiple layers of protection" for the plane.<br><br>

The next morning, he visited the nearby Everett production facility, where two Dreamliner war rooms, called "Root Cause/Corrective Action" and "Return to Flight," had been set up. In one room there was a "fault tree" of possible triggers for the battery failures. Of the 88 initial branches, fewer than six branches were circled in red, orange or yellow as likely causes. He studied a graph showing temperature compared with voltage. "Why aren't you more focused here?" he asked.<br><br>

The war rooms also focused on potential equipment modifications, such as on battery inputs and containers. Mr. McNerney asked about laboratory testing, then proceeded to the plant floor, where he squeezed his 6'2" frame into the small electric bay of one 787 to see how a redesigned battery unit would fit.<br><br>

Before leaving the plant, he pulled aside Messrs. 先生们 Conner and Tracy and said, "Good progress, but turn up your game. You understand that, right?"<br><br>

Two weeks ago, Boeing began officially notifying customers about delays on Dreamliner deliveries.
<br><br>
This week, Mr. McNerney is facing the possibility that investigators may never find the root cause of the battery meltdowns. But he said the team has grown confident it has identified "all probable causes."<br><br>

On Wednesday, Mr. McNerney reviewed the final details of the modified battery and new safeguards Boeing plans to propose to the FAA on Friday. It is seeking permission to conduct test flights to validate the changes, which could eventually lead to the resumption of regular flights.<br><br>

Airlines forced to cancel flights and postpone the opening of new routes are growing impatient. The parent company of United Airlines, for example, said Thursday it is keeping its 787s from nearly all flight schedules through June 5, but remains hopeful it can start a new Denver-Tokyo service with the jet in May.<br><br>

Mr. McNerney just approved plans to have Boeing repair crews ready to be dispatched around the world to install modified batteries and make other changes―as soon as the FAA gives the word.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">McNerney ’71 talks leadership</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
By Susie Poppick<br><br>
Friday, February 13, 2004<br><br>
Teamwork and leadership have been a part of the life of James McNerney ’71 since his college days. Years after pitching for the Yale baseball team ― at the same time President George W. Bush ’68 played second base ― McNerney is now the CEO of 3M.<br><br>
<a href= "link02.html">劳资关系：Give peace a chance</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic06.html">787全球供应链</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic23.html">波音空客销售对比</a><br><br>

McNerney returned to Yale Thursday to speak at a Branford College Master’s Tea about his experiences working as a major business leader. About 40 people attended.
<br><br>
McNerney said international expansion and a culture of innovation distinguish 3M from other companies today.
<br><br>
“We are incredibly innovative and entrepreneurial. We are not interested in acquiring other companies, but in growing ourselves,” McNerney said. “The way we encourage growth is by allowing our scientists to evolve and control their creations, instead of redeploying them to a new place.”
<br><br>
A $16 billion dollar company, 3M is based in St. Paul, Minn., but serves customers in nearly 200 countries, with over half of its sales overseas. A self-declared “diversified technology company,” 3M has, since its founding in 1902, manufactured products ranging from skin-care lotions to computer circuitry. Among the company’s best-known products are Scotch 透明胶 tape and Post-it notes.
<br><br>
McNerney said he believes in “15 percent time,” a policy of giving lab workers free reign over fifteen percent of their work hours, so they can interact with other divisions of the company.
<br><br>
“3M values individual ideas, and what I aim to do is preserve that natural tendency for scientists to walk down the hall,” McNerney said. “For example, Post-its were the result of people walking down the hall, people in nanotechnology 纳米 working with adhesive people. The adhesive in Post-its is like the Holy Grail of adhesives.”
<br><br>
Before becoming CEO of 3M three years ago, McNerney worked in various executive positions at General Electric, Procter & Gamble and McKinsey & Co.
<br><br>
Controversy emerged for 3M when studies found that a chemical in their Scotchguard stain repellant 排斥 products had contaminated 弄脏 and persisted in the bloodstreams of workers, people who used the product, and some animals. The chemical, called perfluorooctane sulfonate, was also detected in water and air. 3M abruptly pulled Scotchguard from the market in 2000, and still faces criticism that the company knew that Scotchguard was unsafe as far back as the 1970s.<br><br>
化工<br><br>
“3M is very environmentally conscious,” McNerney said. “Thirty percent of our capital investment is for environmental control ― We pulled Scotchguard from the shelves as soon as we knew it contained compounds that persist in the human body, which is more than other companies which still use the same chemicals.”
<br><br>
Most students said they were impressed with McNerney’s talk.
<br><br>
“I came to the talk because there are very few people from corporate America who come to speak at Yale,” Ben Rose ’04 said. “Jim McNerney is arguably one of the best CEOs there is. I may be somewhat interested in business, but not the Wall Street variety. Probably something more like 3M, where the values of the company are similar to values of the home.”
<br><br>
Cristina Brito SOM ’04 said she was impressed with the way McNerney answered a question she asked about how he dealt with corruption in business dealings overseas.
<br><br>
“I think it’s unfortunate that more students weren’t here today to see him speak,” Brito said. “He seems to have a very natural intelligence and thoughtfulness, especially in addressing questions. I hope more business leaders feel the way he seems to.”
<br><br>
Joe Aphinyanaphongs ’07 said he enjoyed McNerney’s presentation but thought McNerney could have provided a fuller picture of 3M’s international corporate activities.
<br><br>
“The overall strength of his speech about putting actions into goals was something I definitely enjoyed. But I did notice that he tried to dance around questions about factory labor overseas,” Aphinyanaphongs said.
<br><br>
McNerney is a Branford College Gordon Grand Fellow.

W. James McNerney was the first outsider to head 3M in the conglomerate's 100-year history. His success in this role cemented McNerney's reputation as one of America's most respected business leaders. An executive at General Electric since 1982 McNerney was one of CEO Jack Welch's leading protégés, a star of the highly vaunted 吹牛 GE leadership development system. McNerney's public profile soared in 2000, when he became one of the three contenders in the race to become CEO when Welch retired. When the position went to Jeffrey R. Immelt, McNerney accepted the offer to move to 3M.
<br><br>
Some observers predicted that McNerney's desire to import GE methods into 3M would clash with the culture of innovation and independence that was 3M's hallmark. However, McNerney's managerial qualities enabled him to instigate profound changes in the company while largely maintaining the trust of employees. McNerney was widely praised by staff and analysts as a dynamic and effective leader.
<br><br>
EARLY CAREER
<br><br>
McNerney attended Yale University, where he was on the baseball team with George W. Bush, and then Harvard Business School. After graduation, McNerney's first position was with Procter & Gamble, a company famous for its consumer products such as Pampers disposable diapers and Tide laundry detergent. At Procter & Gamble, McNerney worked in brand management for Ivory soap. He then moved to the management consultancy firm McKinsey & Company for four years.
<br><br>
GE TRAINING GROUND
<br><br>
In 1982 McNerney joined GE as general manager of GE Mobile Communications. Over the next 18 years he held seven positions at GE. Such movement was typical of the GE leadership development model, whereby promising managers moved from job to job every two or three years. The aim was to provide managers with diverse experience and exposure. By the time McNerney was named president and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines in September 1997, it had become obvious to observers that he was being groomed as a possible successor to Welch. McNerney developed a reputation as a skilled team builder and proved his ability to grow the businesses with which he was involved at GE. In particular, during McNerney's time as CEO at GE Aircraft Engines, revenue increased from $6.3 billion, the 1996 figure, to $10.6 billion in 1999. Profits increased from $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion. With McNerney at the helm, GE Aircraft Engines became the second largest profit-making division in GE, behind GE Capital. A major success during this time was restoration of the relationship between GE and Boeing, which led to a deal whereby GE90 engines were supplied to Boeing 777 jets. Boeing executives cited McNerney's sincerity, focus, and decisive, hands-on style as key factors in his success. Although he likely received many lucrative offers from outside GE, McNerney was committed to staying in the race for the top job.

OUTSIDER AT 3M
<br><br>
When Immelt was named Welch's successor in November 2000, McNerney and the third candidate, Robert J. Nardelli, became the most hotly recruited executives in corporate America. As a star of the GE system, McNerney faced extreme expectations of success. The day McNerney was named 3M's next CEO, replacing the retiring Livio D. DeSimone, the price of 3M shares jumped 11 percent. Some observers were skeptical about whether the GE "hotshots" could perform outside the confines of GE, and there were doubts about whether a company as insular as 3M would accept an outsider.
<br><br>
3M, established in 1902 as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, had a long tradition of achieving innovation by allowing its researchers the independence to pursue their projects without interference from management. This approach had produced thousands of successful products, including household names such as Scotch tape, Scotchguard fabric protector, and Post-It notes. 3M leaders had always been chosen from within the company and were therefore largely committed to protecting the existing company culture. In the late 1990s, however, economic conditions changed. Although still a sound performer, 3M had been affected by weakening overseas markets, which had a negative effect on revenue. In particular, the 1997C1998 downturn in the Asian economies hurt 3M, as did the high value of the U.S. dollar in 1996C2000. The company's share price also slipped as the U.S. stock market came to the end of a 10-year growth period. In addition, analysts believed that the 3M leadership lacked dynamism and that the venerable company was underperforming.
<br><br>
3M OR "3E"?
<br><br>
McNerney's mandate when he arrived at 3M was to reinvigorate 振兴 the company. In particular, he aimed to reestablish the company as a growth venture with double-digit growth figures, whereas 3M had been achieving approximately 5 percent. McNerney focused his strategy on initiatives in five key areas: sourcing, indirect costs, e-productivity, 3M Acceleration, and Six Sigma. McNerney faced the difficult task of increasing efficiency and discipline in business while not stifling the innovation for which 3M was famous. One of McNerney's first moves as CEO was to order a global restructuring that cost approximately six thousand jobs, approximately 7 percent of the total workforce. Because this approach seemed to mirror that of Welch, infamous for his job cuts at GE, there were fears that McNerney was trying to turn 3M into "3E." Another profound change that raised fears of a GE takeover was McNerney's drive to implement Six Sigma into 3M. Six Sigma was the management method developed at Motorola in the early 1980s to eliminate inefficiencies and errors. The process was adopted by Welch and expanded to all parts of GE. McNerney also imported the GE system of grading employees to identify and reward performance, a program quite alien to the 3M culture. In addition, McNerney embarked on a major program of acquisitions as part of the aim of increasing sales growth at 3M. GE had been adept at integrating new business, but analysts questioned 3M's lack of experience in this area.
<br><br>
A crucial part of McNerney's strategy was his 3M Acceleration initiative, which targeted the research and development culture at 3M. In a company that prided itself on its independent and unconventional research culture, this program struck 打击/罢工 at the heart of the company's values. Before McNerney's arrival, research and development was spread equally across the various business divisions. This style was based on the premise that all divisions should be encouraged to innovate and grow and that great things could arise from the most unprepossessing beginnings. The purpose of the acceleration program was to focus resources on projects that looked promising and to cull projects that did not. Some observers and employees feared that in modifying 3M's eclectic approach to fostering innovation, McNerney risked destroying the very elements that had made 3M great.

<a href= "pic22.html">表6 美国贸易差额主要来源</a><br><br>

MANAGING CULTURAL CHANGE
<br><br>
From the outset of his tenure as CEO at 3M, McNerney was careful to emphasize he was trying to improve the existing 3M culture, not replace it with the GE culture. In an article in Fortune , McNerney was quoted as saying, "I'm not showing up at 3M with a cultural tool kit that I'm going to transplant" (January 8, 2001). Several factors in McNerney's management approach allayed fears of a GE takeover. He did not arrive at 3M with a band of GE executives in tow 后面 and instead emphasized the quality of the people already at 3M. As a result, 3M staff accepted the concept that they were the ones driving change. Many 3M managers noted that McNerney, instead of dictating changes, encouraged the managers to recognize 3M's assets and identify opportunities. Some of the staff welcomed the accompanying sense of rejuvenation 回春. As one senior employee said in an interview in Fortune , "He's delivered a very consistent message. There's a sense of speed and a sense of urgency" (August 12, 2002). The ability to clearly communicate his vision for the company and empower his employees was McNerney's main asset during the initial period of transition at 3M. Many observers cited McNerney's low-key style and lack of arrogance 傲慢 as important factors in his success (HUMBLE/谦虚). In the age of the celebrity CEO, McNerney preferred to avoid the spotlight and instead concentrated on building relationships with those around him at 3M.
<br><br>
By the beginning of 2004 McNerney had moved out of the shadow of Welch and GE. Financial indicators ensured general optimism about the success of McNerney's strategy at 3M. Revenue increased 11.6 percent, to $18.2 billion in 2003, and net income increased 21.7 percent to $2.4 billion. The value of 3M stock increased 38 percent over 2003. In late 2003 rumors that McNerney would head Boeing were proved wrong when he announced he would be staying with 3M. Business analysts agreed that McNerney's work at 3M was not over, and most observers remained uncommitted about whether Six Sigma and 3M Acceleration had improved or detracted from 3M's traditional strengths. Nevertheless, the initial success of McNerney's tenure at 3M resulted in his being held up as an example of the benefits of injecting new blood into long-established companies. McNerney's challenge in 2004 was to prove that his business strategy had improved 3M's organic growth rate―the growth in sales revenue from products developed within 3M as opposed to those acquired from outside businesses. The outcome would indicate whether McNerney's drive for efficiency and discipline was compatible with the 3M culture of innovation. In 2004 McNerney was on the boards of directors of Boeing, Procter & Gamble, and the Greater Twin Cities United Way.<br><br>

DAVID BRADLEY: Well, let me welcome the Council members. Let me welcome our guests. Let me welcome our guest of honor, Jim McNerney, who is the chairman and CEO of the Boeing Corporation.
<br><br>
Some of you will remember Bob Bennett, who is a large signature figure in the corridors of power here in Washington. Famously, he was President Clinton's personal attorney back in the unhappiness of the second term for the president.
<br><br>
He tells the story about himself. It was summer of 1998, and he and his wife were invited to have dinner alone with President and Mrs. Clinton in the family quarters of the White House. And he was instructed to drive to the south gate. So he drove there. And to his surprise the guard said, no, you're going to be driving in. Just drive straight up the driveway to the Southern Portico.<br><br>

And up there, there was a guard. And the guard said, just park right here. And he parked. And as he was going in, the guard said to him, Mr. Bennett, are you from New York? And he said, yes, I am from New York. How did you know that? And he said, well, here at the White House, it's only the New Yorkers who lock their car doors on the way in. (Laughter.)
<br><br>
And I was thinking of that, sort of apropos of nothing last night, when I was writing these. But if you have to do a bridge, it would be signature power in these Washington corridors.<br><br>

This is as close as we have to corporate royalty in the United States. So look at the stations of the cross. There's Yale varsity baseball. There's Yale varsity baseball with George W. Bush, Harvard Business School, McKinsey, General Electric, discovered by Jack Welch at General Electric and mentored by him, chairman and CEO of 3M, and then, since 2005, chairman and CEO of the Boeing Corporation, chairman of the Business Roundtable and chairman of President Obama's Export Council.
<br><br>
So this is the resume you want when you go back to high school reunion and you come across the girl who wouldn't go out with you. (Laughter.) And she says, oh, my gosh, Jim. What have you been doing all your life? (Laughter.)<br><br>

Let me road-map the conversation now. I'm going to interview Jim for about a half-hour, and then we'll take the second half of our time together and open it up for questions and answers.<br><br>

Housekeeping. The conversation today is on the record. Could I ask you all to turn off your mobile phones, not simply put them on vibrate? Apparently they interfere with the sound system here. And then the final announcement: On September 20th, Julius Genachowski, who is the chairman of the FCC, is going to be having lunch here, and everyone is welcome for that.<br><br>

So it's very good to have you here, Jim.<br><br>

JIM MCNERNEY: Thank you.<br><br>

BRADLEY: Welcome.<br><br>

MCNERNEY: Good to be here. Just move from vibrate to silent.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Thank you.
<br><br>
So there was a famous Boeing PowerPoint shortly after your tenure began at Boeing. The general counsel put up a slide, and the slide had two long numbers on it. And he said these are not zip codes. These are the federal prison numbers of the former CFO at Boeing and the woman, the airport -- sorry -- Air Force officer whom he is accused of having bribed.
<br><br>
So right in the four years before Jim's arrival at Boeing, there were a series of scandals, some in a teapot scale, but the CFO left and two CFOs in a row left in a hard hour. And you were brought in expressly as a business and a moral turnaround artist.
<br><br>
So most of us are not going to be in that position in life. Just for a moment, as if it weren't on the record, pull back the curtain a little bit and tell us -- (laughter) -- so what is it like to be the CEO, to arrive. What's day one there? What did you find when you arrived at Boeing?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, first of all, just a big business opportunity, so just leave that aside. Boeing had a lot of strengths in its products and technology and its people. But there had been a cultural element that had produced some -- (audio break) -- the wrong things. And it was a very small number of people, but I've always held the view that even small missteps or big missteps by just a few people are reflective of the overall culture.
<br><br>
And so the approach was to start at the beginning --
<br><br>
BRADLEY: But let me just drill down for a moment. What's the cultural thing? What was it you found that was anomalous to --<br><br>

MCNERNEY: Well, I mean, it's people that -- very few people who felt they were immune from the rules, OK. And that generally comes -- it can be a subtle form of arrogance. It can be we do things that are so important that we don't have to -- we don't have to play by the rules.
<br><br>
Now, obviously the vast majority of Boeing folks, even back at that stage, didn't view the world that way at all. They felt a huge -- it was a huge honor as well as responsibility to do the kind of work we do. But I think, as I came in, I had to -- I had to presume that the culture needed a ground-up discussion.
<br><br>
And so it was sort of one conference room at a time, you know, talking to our people, deciding what we wanted to be, a ground-up discussion not only for business strategy but the kind of attributes we wanted to have as leaders, the kind of values that were important to us.
<br><br>
Now, most people felt that this was a gratuitous discussion. I didn't. I mean, I thought that there are times when you -- in your life, whether it's a corporate life or a personal life, where sort of a ground-up examination and discussion to remind you what's important and what is foundational is a good thing. And that was a time in Boeing's history when we needed to do that. So it was a very personal mission.
<br><br>
I think the prison numbers -- that was the first large meeting I had, and I wanted to make the point that this is personal, that this is about how each and every one of us carry ourselves and the responsibilities we have and the fortune we have to serve our country. And to be involved with the technology that we're involved with carries huge responsibilities. So it was sort of a -- it was -- I viewed it as a leadership exercise.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Was there a cinematic moment? Was there a moment where you had to not blink? Or was the culture ready to roll over already?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, no, I think the -- most people were very disappointed. And it was sort of -- this disappointment blended in with a little bit of a loss of confidence, a little bit of a loss of swagger. And I mean swagger in the good sense.
<br><br>
And so I think people were ready for this discussion. Remember, everybody, since 1960, were always the proudest ones at the cocktail parties because they worked for Boeing. I mean, this is an iconic American company. And so against that background, the disappointment probably hurt even more. So I think they were ready for this kind of discussion.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: March 2005 also would have been a good time to buy Boeing stock. It was up 40 percent across the next two years.
<br><br>
So let's move forward to the present. Boeing sells planes all over the world. Let's take commercial plane sales or back orders as a currency, as a metric. Looking at your sales around the world, what can you tell us about the global economy? Do you see it's coming back, or does it feel flat-lined?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: I think, in sum, the global economy is growing slightly. But it's a tale of two cities, the developed world and the developing world. I think Asia, led by China, notwithstanding some discussion about China slowing down just a little bit, but I think Asia and the Middle East are growing mid to high single digits. And I see that as attainable.
<br><br>
I think the U.S. and Europe -- and they both have the same dynamics, which is some political stagnation as well as some economic stagnation, and the two are related. And I think -- I'm confident our country will get through this phase. And my guess is Europe will too, but it's -- but I think it's very slow growth in aggregate is what I see for the next five, six years.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Here in the United States, is it any better or any worse than it was six months ago?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: I would characterize it as about the same.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: And how about Europe?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: I think Europe may be slightly worse, based on what I've seen. But I'm -- I don't have a -- my aperture isn't across the entire economy. But when you sum up conversations and personal observations, same here, slightly worse there. Now, here it's not good enough.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: If you had to guess what percent of Boeing commercial jets would be sold in North America and Europe across the next 10 years, as opposed to the rest of the world, where would you put that?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, I think the U.S. and Europe would probably be about half, and Asia, Middle East, Latin America would also be half. That's a dramatic shift from five years ago, for example, where it was two thirds, one third. So this is very reflective of the global economy and the progress the developing world is making.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: The current issue of Foreign Affairs has an article that talks about the United States loss in market share in the sale of arms around the world; that as recently as the 1990s, we were around 60 percent of global market share, and we're down to about 30 percent.
<br><br>
What's your insider's take on what's going on?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, again, I think it's -- there's all kinds of theories about why that is happening. Some theories talk about the loss of U.S. assertiveness around the world and the follow-on cooperation --
<br><br>
BRADLEY: In our foreign policy, military and foreign policy?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yes. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's -- I don't necessarily subscribe to that, but that's one theory. Another theory is that the developing world is producing more arms. And Europe no longer has a market for their own production. So you've got lots of production chasing business that is growing, but some of these -- some of the more advantaged people are folks in other parts of the world.
<br><br>
I think the -- so it's -- now, my personal view is I don't think it's quite that -- I don't think it's quite that dramatic.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: You don't -- (inaudible) --
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: I don't believe those numbers, I guess, is what I would say. It depends on what you do with those numbers. If you -- (inaudible) -- as well as fighters, then -- but most of the technologically advanced stuff, I'd say the market share has stayed roughly the same, OK, with the U.S. dominating. But that's a matter of the two of us sorting out the numbers.
<br><br>
But there certainly are more of the mid-tier and lower-tier armaments coming from other parts of the world than the United States than there used to be, that's for sure.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Is this OK? Is that going to be OK with you?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: I'm fine. I'm fine.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: If it isn't, then why don't we start over? (Laughter.)
<br><br>
I'm happy to welcome Jim McNerney. (Laughter.)
<br><br>
Let's use the -- if it's all right with you, let's use the Dreamliner as a way to get into the conversation about U.S. manufacturing. But let's start with the happy news of the Dreamliner. What did Boeing get right about this plane that Airbus missed?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, there was a fundamental choice to be made at the beginning of the last decade, analogous to the choice that computer manufacturers had 30 years ago, which is keep building bigger and bigger or build smaller, more capable. We chose smaller, more capable. And so -- and our worthy competitors chose bigger.
<br><br>
I think the results suggest that our choice was a good one in the sense that more people wanted to fly point to point, not through hubs, security lines. Fuel efficiency was more of -- was more built into our strategy. And so long range, point to point, 20 percent fuel improvement, which is a huge fuel improvement with new composites and new engines and things, as opposed to just take a 747 and make it bigger.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Yeah.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: So I think we made the right call. I think, reflective of their choices since then, it has been to sort of move in the direction --
<br><br>
BRADLEY: They're migrating your way.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yeah. And we did.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: To the manufacturing side, I was chatting with Jim Fallows, whom you know, before -- sometime last week about this. And he said ask the question about what did Boeing learn about outsourcing where the manufacture.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, we learned -- we learned what every industry learns, which is when you go too far, it's a problem, OK. And I think --
<br><br>
BRADLEY: What are you referencing?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: I'm referencing to outsourcing too much.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Mmm hmm.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: And we not only outsourced manufacturing to a somewhat greater degree than we had on previous models, but we outsourced some of the engineering. And so we lost some control of the configuration. Of course, we didn't think we were doing that at the time.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Right.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: But I think, in a practical world, we went a step too far. And so I think we're looking at more vertical business models now where we regain some control over some elements of the manufacturing, as well as the design.
<br><br>
The good news is with the 787 is we got the product right.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Right.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: We did the right product. We stumbled on the implementation. We learned from it. And in subsequent new models, a new model on the 87 plus our new narrow-body model, it's more reflective of greater control over some of these elements and requires a little more capital. But it's -- it gives us much greater control over our costs, our delivery and our quality.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Is that an important distinction between the engineering and the pure manufacturing --
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, in these --
<br><br>
BRADLEY: -- as to this issue?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: In these kinds of products it is, because, you know, an airliner, commercial airliner, is 4 million individually designed parts.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Yeah.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Now, you can always make the argument that, hey, you do those 50,000 parts and you do those 30,000 parts. But when it all comes together, there's very few computer models that -- we got a little bit seduced that it all would come together seamlessly and the same design rules would be applied everywhere in the world, and corners wouldn't be cut and financial realities wouldn't hit certain folks. And so --
<br><br>
BRADLEY: (Inaudible.)
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yeah. Yeah. And so it's -- in this kind of product, more vertical control is needed. And we just went too far and had to learn the hard way.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Yeah. Moving -- shifting to your hat of chairman of the Export Council --
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yeah.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: -- what is your thought on the competitiveness of the United States as to the pure manufacturing of manufactured goods?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, I think the -- there has been a lot of discussion about how we're losing competitiveness in manufacturing. For many of the industries that really count, I don't think we are. I think we are in some --
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Enumerate.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: And when I say count, I'm not trying to suggest that there's great industries and then there's lousy industries. What I'm trying to suggest is those industries where we are globally competitive, we still do a lot of it ourselves. Aerospace is one. Electronics, medical equipment, tend to be the more technologically advanced software. Those kinds of industries we tend to maintain good strength in, both the development and the manufacturing and fabrication of it.
<br><br>
I think we've been hollowed out, and we've done it with some of our own policies -- hollowed out the lower-valued manufacturing. Now, that's -- there's a tension there with jobs and joblessness, so there has to be a political reality that's addressed there. You just don't want to ship every work activity somewhere else. I mean, you lose control over quality. You lose control over your supply chain. That's a consideration and a learning from the 787. But it's also a political reality that you have to deal with.
<br><br>
So we support policies in this country that are favorable to U.S. manufacturing.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Does it matter to you whether it gets manufactured in the United States or overseas?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yes. I mean, I think the -- but it's not a simple answer, OK, because, you know, we're a very global company that has global markets and global governments that we work with. And so they're insisting on work placement that is beyond our capacity to place work there. But there's a tension there.
<br><br>
But our view, particularly post-787, having a little more direct control, having a common culture across vital parts of our manufacturing, suppliers that are proximate to us. The value of that is -- has become clear to us in our cycle; so a little bit more shading in that direction.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: There's talk about the United States reviving as a manufacturing country. Does that feel like just this moment in time? Or would you say, no, I can see how we can be like Germany and --
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: I think we're -- we were not the only industry that hollowed out too much. I think we all learned -- many people in my positions across many different big American companies have learned the lesson of going too horizontal.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Yeah.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: And so I think a number of us are bringing it back. And it's not necessarily because of political pressure. It's because of satisfying our customers. I mean, we let our customers down with these horizontal, far-flung supply chains. We're still going to do that, but not for everything, and -- because we lost control of our quality, cost and delivery. And those are the fundamentals. And that's what our customers need.
<br><br>
So it's -- I think -- I think the linchpin right now, the bottleneck right now, is education. I mean, I think -- and you may want to get onto that, and I'll just jump into it.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: No, go ahead.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: I mean, big manufacturers -- you need Ph.D.s to design the airplanes. You need graduates to lead large chunks of your organization. But we need vocational training as well to build and assemble these -- and service these and maintain these airplanes, which in and of itself is high-value work. And we're falling down a little bit. And I know the administration and others are beginning to get focused on vocational training.
<br><br>
If you're talking just about American manufacturing, vocational training is something that this country needs to refocus on. And we're seeing examples of it. In Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, who's got his plate full with other things today, but Rahm is focused on vocational training. And there's other initiatives we're beginning to see around the country. But I think that's important.
<br><br>
It's not unlike the German model, where vocational training is highly valued societally as well as in the business community. We've lost a little bit of that capability. It's often referred to as the middle class. I've lost track of what the middle class means now.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Yeah.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: But it's -- but we need to focus a little bit more there. We have to train the people that come to work for us to do assembly maintenance and technician kind of work. We spend two or three times as much time training them as we used to, because we're not finding people that have got these basic skills.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: If you were not an American company and you were just operating out of some tax haven somewhere -- Netherlands Antilles -- would you be able to find, for this kind of labor, not the Ph.D. but the service man?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yeah.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Would you be able to find that labor better and cheaper? How many other countries would you be able to find that better and cheaper than in the United States?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, it's hard for me to give you a hard answer. I mean, I think the -- I think -- let me answer it this way, David. I think we've lost a relative advantage there with that kind of worker.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Yeah.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: And that's really the point. I mean, and I think the developing world is doing a better job of producing people with a base level of education, with an expectation that they can ladder up from where their parents were and be happy with that kind of work. I think we just need to refocus there, because there's a lot of places around the world where that can be done. And in many cases, I'd rather do it here.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Just before we leave that topic altogether, I have three sons who are really good at that sort of thing. And if you wouldn't mind, as we lift it up -- (laughter).<br><br>

Let's go to China. So China is both a --<br><br>

MCNERNEY: We'll see how the interview goes, David. (Laughter.)<br><br>

BRADLEY: Did you hear the part about Boeing stock up 40 percent -- (laughter) -- within the first two years of --
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: (Laughs.) Getting better. Warmer, warmer.<br><br>

BRADLEY: (Laughs.) So China is both a customer and a potential competitor. I'm gathering -- I don't want to prejudge it, but I'm gathering you'd prefer them as a customer than a competitor.
<br><br>
What is -- what's it like to deal with the Chinese?<br><br>

BRADLEY: Well, you're dealing with -- you've characterized it right, David. We have to accept the reality of both competing with them and partnering with them. Their market is too big to not partner with them. And they're too good not to end up competing with. And so you just can't get trapped in these either-or kind of paradigms. You just have to live in the world.<br><br>

They are highly -- to answer your question directly, they're highly competent. They are increasingly well-educated. And they are very motivated. And I think --<br><br>

BRADLEY: What do you mean by that?<br><br>

MCNERNEY: They want to improve their lives, you know. They want to improve their lives. And their parents want them to improve their lives. And the family unit is strong. And so, of course, there are issues. They have the huge issue of the rural-urban migration, housing costs, inflation. They have issues like everybody else has issues.
<br><br>
But they've got some fundamentals -- education, motivation, scale, money, ability to export for foreign exchange. And they're wrestling with, obviously, the dichotomy of a political system that is a little -- remains a little top-down and a market system that wants to be bottom-up. But they're showing signs of --<br><br>

BRADLEY: Can you see the elements of the top-down still?<br><br>

MCNERNEY: Oh sure, sure.<br><br>

BRADLEY: How does that present?<br><br>

MCNERNEY: Well, I think more decisions are made by the government in the normal course of business in China than here. And the -- I mean, one example would be when we sell an airplane to China Eastern, there are two steps to the process.
<br><br>
Step one is convincing the airline to buy our airplane, and then step two is working with the airline to gain government approval for the sale. And that's the way they do business. And in the United States, the airline can simply make the decision on their own. But that's -- I don't want to judge it. I mean, we just want to line up to support the way they want to do business, and --<br><br>

BRADLEY: When we were talking before, last week, you mentioned the fact that you can sometimes read in Chinese conduct, as to Boeing, signals that are being sent to the U.S. Would you explain that?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, yes. I mean, I think because chunks of our business are so big, when we typically do a deal, it's somewhere between $1 (billion) and $20 billion. And so occasionally we find ourselves as -- occasionally find ourselves in a position of one government wanting to send a message to another about the status of the relationship. And obviously we want to be honest brokers in the midst of all of that and want to be judged only on our capability. But there are times when that happens. And you see that in big projects in other things.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Cybersecurity. It's a hot issue to read about. Is it, in fact, a real problem? And give us --
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yeah.<br><br>

BRADLEY: How big a thing is it at Boeing?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: It's very big. I think cyber warfare, to just parrot the term that's increasingly being used, is real. I mean, I think there are an increasing number of cyber incidents in this country. And so there is an industry that's beginning to grow that prepares institutions to defend themselves from this. And it's -- but it's -- I can tell you it's real. It's a reality that most big institutions, companies and otherwise, have to spend a lot of time and resources on to fight and mitigate it.<br><br>

BRADLEY: Not for actual data, but just order of magnitude, are we talking about a dozen times a year, a hundred times a year?<br><br>

MCNERNEY: Thousands.<br><br>

BRADLEY: Thousands.<br><br>

MCNERNEY: Exactly.<br><br>

BRADLEY: And roughly from how many countries?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, I mean, there's a lot -- there's -- it's hard to know, because a lot of these institutions or individuals do a pretty good job of masking where they're coming from. And that's part of the game. But I'd leave -- I'll leave the press to speculate on where all this comes from.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: We're good at that. We're happy to do that. (Laughter.)
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: And I could only get in trouble. (Laughter.)
<br><br>
BRADLEY: As part of your work, you get to meet heads of state around the world. And I can't imagine they don't want to ask you questions about the United States, about the president, about the election. What do heads of state ask about the United States these days?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: They really would like us to get our house in order. You know, I think --
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Referring to the deficit?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yeah. I mean, I think sometimes it's framed as the U.S. presence here or there isn't as strong as it used to be, or sometimes you get the other discussion, which it's too interventionalist here. But I think what they really want is a strong United States.
<br><br>
I mean, I think -- and the conversation eventually gets around to this -- we are a stabilizing influence around the world and a -- whether it's military deterrence -- that could be framed that way -- or whether it's economic strength -- it could be framed that way -- whether it's diplomatic intervention, even-handedness representing free market, rule-of-law kind of trade.
<br><br>
You know, we tend to represent a lot of things that are reflected in others' behaviors when we're stronger. And so I think it -- I was anticipating this question, so I thought about it. And that's really what it gets down to. They'd like to see us get by our current divisiveness, settle on what we settle on, and I have an abiding faith that the United States is going to pragmatically resolve the differences that seem insurmountable today. I just really believe that. And I think when that's done, I think everybody will feel a little more comfortable about us.
<br><br>
And that may be a little bit of a leap, based on your question, but I think that's what they really want.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Jim, if you can lock in on a particular conversation that you've had, like this one -- don't mention with whom, but something that's vivid in your mind. Help us understand, what's the tone that these questions are asked -- in sadness, in astonishment? Is there a presumption already that the United States is in decline? What does it feel like in the conversation?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: It's usually framed from a consequence that's happening that wouldn't have happened before. I mean, it could be a smaller country that is troubled by another big country's presence -- or military, economic, whatever -- that might not have happened with a -- with a stronger America. Something like that.
<br><br>
But I think -- for example, I spent some time in the Pacific earlier this year, and I think the Obama administration is aware of this. And the sort of the assertiveness you're beginning to see in Asia, for example, is designed to mitigate some of that in a part of the world where our relationships are going to be critical for the next 100 years, absolutely critical.
<br><br>
But again, I get back to just -- and I know I'm being a little boring here, but a strong United States. I mean, everything -- and I'm going to sound like a businessman now, and I am one -- really, most of our country's strength flows from our industrial and economic base. And that is a sort of -- that is foundational. And other kinds of strength and influence really can't happen without that. That's why I go back to that as a root cause, even though we're in a foreign policy forum here. And we could talk about FTA's and we could talk about export control and we could talk about commercial diplomacy and all the other elements that I focus on in the Export Council. But the most meaningful thing, in my view, is just getting on to what we do best.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: If -- this will be the last question, and then we'll open it up. If we were taking a poll of the Business Roundtable and asking them to give a grade to how well they think Washington is performing -- I don't mean the current administration; let's take it across the last eight years, so it's Washington more generally. What would be your guess on -- what's the grade Washington gets?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, I think the grade would be -- well, most business leaders are disappointed and think we can do better, let's put it that way. I think the -- and you know what that's embodied in, quite frankly? I think most business leaders like myself are more ready for a compromise on a lot of the -- across the political divide here than our political leaders are. I mean, the -- I don't know whether it's Simpson-Bowles or whether it's some other proposal that shades in one direction or another -- I'm convinced that's where we're eventually going to end up.
<br><br>
It's -- and I think we would trade the certainty of some resolution, even if it's not perfect from our point of view, with the uncertainty of continuing to die -- both sides dying on the cross. And so I think this certainty thing, which I know sounds amorphous and it sounds like an excuse on an earnings call -- (laughter) -- but it is important.
<br><br>
And what I think will happen -- because I do have an abiding faith in us, I think what will happen is there will be some compromise after someone gets elected here. And six to 12 months, I don't know, there will be some compromise forged. It will not be too different than the compromise we looked at two and a half years ago. (Laughter.) And it's a little bit of a lament, which is, gee, couldn't we have gotten on with this a little bit earlier?
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Let's open it up to questions. If you would, it's protocol here, please raise your hand and wait until a microphone comes to you. And then if you'll give us your name and affiliation -- and if you will keep questions or comments to a reasonable length.
<br><br>
Why don't we start with this gentleman here on the aisle, and then let's go to this woman here in the blue. So whoever else; I think we've got two microphones. Could we bring one up here for the woman in the front row.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Bob Winter, with Arnold and Porter. Sir, you mentioned your focus on the strength of the economy. And at one point, in discussing Boeing's own experience in going too horizontal, you mentioned, but that would have required more capital -- or the solution requires more capital.
<br><br>
I wonder if you would comment on the potentially negative impact in American industry and finance on focus on trying to undertake business and finance activities with a minimum of capital. A lot of people have thought that that was a serious factor in the financial crisis and I think your comment suggests that that may have been a significant factor in the hollowing out and going too horizontal in the economy as well more broadly.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yes. I'd never connected those dots the way you just did it with your question, but you're right. I mean, a lot of these financial structures basically had the effect of piling more debt on less capital, whatever the structure was. And you could argue that horizontal manufacturing structures have some of the same element to it.
<br><br>
I think -- look, I think we went too far in both areas. The business models are seductive, OK, and I think the -- there may be a little more learning on the financial services side than there is on our side, but it's a little bit of a management 101 lesson. And it's all about your customers.
<br><br>
If you frame it, you get the politics and the ideology out of it when you focus on, are you delivering to your customers or not effectively. And with our more horizontal business model, we were not delivering to our customers. So we need to regain control. We need to spend more capital. We're going to spend more capital. There will be some disappointed suppliers who are doing somewhat less work for us because we're doing it for ourselves. But we're going to have better products, higher quality products that are more expeditiously delivered.
<br><br>
But it's an interesting way to frame that.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: We'll go to the front row.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: This has been a -- I'm Missy Warsheim, with the Naval postgraduate School. This has been a fascinating experience for me this last hour because I joined IBM in 1981 when it was considered the best corporation in the world; I was there two weeks and realized it was on a downhill slide. But anyway -- (laughter) --
<br><br>
I want to ask about education. I think there are some basic things missing from our general education system, which turns out to be process systems, context and consequences. Doesn't exist. And I think unless you have that kind of foundation to look at problems, it's very hard to know how to address them. As a corporation, and clearly as a national leader, how do I get you to start talking about some of this so we can move the educational system into being what I consider 21st century competitive on a global basis?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, we do a lot of talking about it because I share your view, and we spend a lot of money on it. But I don't think we're being effective yet, OK, and I share the frustration with you totally. And it gets down to families and local school systems eventually and that has a different set of dynamics than you and I are used to dealing with. And you're seeing it played out in Chicago today. I mean, it's a tussle between a school system that wants to be run a little bit differently and a union that resists it. And that discussion goes on everywhere around the country.
<br><br>
So we've got to -- I think once we get through this political season we're in right now, I think both presidents want to address this issue. I really do. I think President Obama does. I also think Governor Romney does. And I think once we get through this, we have a chance to focus on it. And I think the solutions involve some money, they involve some focus. May involve doing some things at the local level that the local level doesn't want to do to ensure some quality.
<br><br>
But it looks to me like whoever ends up winning the election, we have a chance to deal with it. But hope springs eternal.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: If you'd give the microphone to that gentleman right there. And would you give this microphone to Mr. Rall beside you.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Good afternoon. I'm Jonathan Hopkins. You mentioned the importance of certainty, and I think a lot of us might agree with this. But could you give us tangible examples that help us think about this fiscal cliff coming up at the end of this year. And we have an uncertainty problem with the debt downgrade and the lack of a debt deal earlier last year -- or this year.
<br><br>
Could you give us a tangible example of decisions that you made different, or if you held more capital as a result of knowing these problems were not getting solved, so we can understand how this affects business tangibly?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yes. I mean, we are laying off more people in our defense business than we otherwise would because of the uncertainty around sequestration. I mean, there is some capability that we'd like to retain, and if we knew which way it was going to go. So that's one example. And I'm not the only one in the defense industry. I think long-term capital spending, that's less of a Boeing issue. Our industry is a little stronger than some, but when you listen to Alan Greenspan speak, he'll tell you the data he looks at shows long-term capital investment going down.
<br><br>
When you don't know the tax rate, when you don't know the government policy, when the regulatory environment is, in the view of some, not as friendly as it could be, people get nervous. And he's presented to me numbers that show -- and long-term capital has an R squared with long-term employment of about 95. I mean, it's a biggie.
<br><br>
And I think those are two pretty good examples. I think the smaller the business, the more this -- the more this plays because that's -- are often -- the small company that, and so you're nervous already and when a lot of these factors you don't know, it's -- so we've just got to get through this. Certainty -- as I pointed out, compromise involving certainty has higher value than the answer you want.
<br><br>
MR. : You had a great frame for this as soon as we walked in. You said, referencing the fact that layoffs have to take place, considering the possibility of sequestration, that for American corporations sequestration is already here.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yes. Well, I mean, that's -- it is already here. I mean, it's been with us for a year. I mean, just imagine sitting in front of your board -- and I'm looking at John Bryson here -- Secretary Bryson was a board member of Boeing many years ago -- and saying, John, by the way, you now, there's a fiscal cliff that might be coming and we're going to keep spending, we're going to keep hiring. That's not the discussion you have.
<br><br>
And so -- but you know, Secretary Bryson, it's great to see you here. We're talking about global trade policy and there was no firmer champion of some of that stuff than you, so it's good to have you here.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Mr. Raul?
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Alan Raul, from Sidley Austin. My question is about the impact of federal regulation on the economy. It's an article of faith among many in the business community that, left to its own devices, Washington will over-regulate business and have a negative impact on the economy.
<br><br>
President Obama issued several executive orders echoing his predecessor's interest in cost-benefit analysis, including one on streamlining regulations and harmonizing with the rest of the international community. Could you address what the impact is that you see on Boeing and other corporations for federal regulation, how you interact on Washington to rationalize that process.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, I mean there's always a tension between the business community and the regulatory environment. There's always a tension. And I think the business community has had some very direct and occasionally heated discussion, particularly early in the administration here. It was constructively received. I mean, I think -- I'm remembering particularly on the energy side, some on the labor side. We had a little dust-up down in South Carolina that some of you may remember -- (laughter) -- where we thought we were getting a little over-regulated.
<br><br>
And I've seen some progress on a couple of these places. The medical world is up in arms occasionally. But I think we've seen more signs over the last year and a half or so that the administration is trying to meet us halfway in a couple of spots. I think at the end of the day we still feel -- we still feel if you just let us run, we know how to create jobs, we know how to be globally competitive and there's sometimes a few too many steps. And so we'd like to see more progress made and we'll keep advocating for that and working with the administration to do that.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: The gentleman in the back -- and the lady in the back in red.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Hello. Frank Finelli, from the Carlyle Group. But thank you very much for your comments. As you look at the multiple hundred billion dollar backlog of commercial aircraft at Boeing, how do you see aircraft financing and leasing unfolding, given the stress in the banking system in Europe and the emerging markets, some of your traditional sources of financing?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, Carlyle probably has a modest interest in how it's all going to turn out. (Laughter.) Say hi to my friends there, please. So far what's happened is, and Europe -- my guess is you're somewhat aware of this -- is that we're seeing the European banks back away a little bit. We're seeing the capital markets step in, and we're beginning to see some financing out of Asia, particularly China, as they've teamed with some Singaporeans and Hong Kong to set up some pretty good-sized leasing companies.
<br><br>
So, so far, that math has worked. So -- but having said that, do we want the European banking crisis to get sorted out in a hurry? Yes, OK. Meanwhile, though, the capital markets at Asia have pretty much -- have pretty much made up for it, and actually more than made up for it. So we're not in extremis yet.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Greta Lindbergh, NSS. I'd be interested in your perspective on Russia PNTR. Thanks.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, I think most of the American business community favors it. The WTO without PNTR equals not much, and so we need to reform that, keeping in mind America's security interest as you do it. But I think it needs to -- I think we need to get there, we need to get there more quickly. I spend a lot of time advocating for it. I'm a little biased in the sense that Boeing has a lot of business there. We have a number of joint ventures there.
<br><br>
I'm aware of the perils of doing business there, but again, you know, I sound like a dinosaur but engagement is generally the way into the end zone with entities that aren't like you and aren't perfect, and just try to work it. Especially at a time when we need jobs and we need growth and they need our stuff.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: The gentleman right here -- and how about this woman up here.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Hi. Cameron Carey of General Counsel, at the Commerce Department. I want to circle back to the opening subject, the history of bribery and development of a corporate culture to change that. You're in a sector that's been particularly susceptible to those issues globally. One of the things we've been working on at the Department of Commerce and across the government is to try to level the playing field for the United States through mechanisms like the anti-bribery convention, trying to get trading partners to enforce or adopt a clause against transnational bribery.
<br><br>
Are you seeing an impact of those efforts in the corporate cultures and the business practices of competitors around the world?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Yes. I think -- I think American and European companies, not withstanding the doubling of scrutiny -- I'm just guessing a doubling -- you know, FCPA and other things, the amount of environment, notwithstanding all that, I think the behavior I see is better for American and European. I mean, this -- there were a couple of incidents in Europe, Siemens, BAE and some others, where they were pretty aggressively dealt with. I mean, it was discontinuously dealt with in Europe, which I think helped. And now they're part of some more international efforts. And so I see, I see improved behavior there.
<br><br>
It's hard to assess other parts of the globe and it's not as visible, the entities aren't public and so you're sort of left with anecdotal rumor and things like that so I hesitate to sort of jump in. I would say in the developed world the answer to your question is yes. Still not good enough in some cases, but yes.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Hi. Andrea Shalal-Esa, with Reuters. And I just wanted to ask you today, while you've been sitting here, there's been a lot of discussion in Europe about a merger of EADS and BAE Systems. And I wonder if you can speak to that and what the impact will be on Boeing particularly, from having basically Airbus now in your backyard to a specific facility coming, whether you're concerned about that?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, listen, I just caught those rumors this morning myself --
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: It's been confirmed, so --
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: And so, OK -- I think from my perspective -- and I'm thinking about it quickly here -- I have a pretty deep and abiding faith in our company's strength, OK, so I don't see this as something that is going to threaten us fundamentally. It does reflect a global consolidation that is beginning to happen.
<br><br>
I think this may be a matter of -- from an EADS standpoint maybe some increased U.S. market access because BAE's entity here, and the entity, when it's put together does look a little more like us. And that's been a steady theme in EADS's development over the years. So I wouldn't want to comment beyond that because I really haven't studied it.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: The gentleman on the aisle here. And I was going to say, there's somebody over here, but --
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Hi. Mike Mosettig, with the PBS Online NewsHour.
<br><br>
You mentioned health care. How much are businesses like your affected by this uncertainty of what kind of a health care system we're going to end up with? And how do your health care costs compare with that of Airbus? (Laughter.)
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, first of all, we're making the assumption that the current health care system that's law will happen. That's our assumption. And the -- how our health care costs compare with Airbus, I must admit in a public forum, I'm not sure. They have a completely different health care system there and I'm not sure how the money moves around, quite frankly. And it's -- but as to the -- our health care system, there's a law on the books that we're working toward complying with.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: This gentleman here and this woman right here, if you will.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: David Slade; Allen and Overy. On the subject of how well the U.S. government does supporting American business abroad, I was talking with someone from the State Department recently who made a comment to the effect that it takes two to tango, and that there are sometimes some markets -- I think he was referring in particular to northern Africa, where he wished there was more American business interest to support.
<br><br>
I was wondering if you could comment on that. Should American business be more aggressive around the globe, or is there -- are there times when you feel like the government would like to take you places where you don't really want to go?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Listen, we get pretty good support from our government, whether it's Secretary Bryson's Commerce Department, where the support is fundamental businesses processes, boots on the ground, advocacy here in Washington influencing the administration in a way that's favorable to us. Or whether it's the president himself advocating for major projects or Boeing aircraft when -- when he has the opportunity. We get pretty good support.
<br><br>
Now having said that, there are countries -- and China's a good example -- that has multiples of that kind of support, you know, and it's -- I think they're viewing it as a start-up. Africa's a good place. I'm sure China might have been the country you were referring to, where when there are major projects to be had and there's a Chinese competitor they're very aggressive. There's lots of people.
<br><br>
Now we happen to think our technology's better. We don't think we need as many people there to convince people of that, but it's -- it is a factor out there that we have to deal with and we're seeing that more and more.
<br><br>
QUESTIONER: Thank you. I'm Genie Nguyen, with Voice of Vietnamese Americans. Would you share with us the vision about the TPP -- and with that Trans-Pacific Partnership.
<br><br>
As a negotiator, what would be a few important points you want the U.S. to emphasize? And how -- do you have hope that we will get what we want?
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Well, I do have hope that we'll have a good agreement. I think the important thing is to minimize the exceptions and have consistency, which of course is hard. But I think that's what the U.S. needs, is few country-by-country exceptions. This is a -- TPP is huge. I've forgotten exactly how many of the world's consumers are involved in TPP but it's by far the biggest trading partnership that has ever been attempted.
<br><br>
And it is critical because many of our competitors in the developed world have relationships with these countries and we don't. So on a competitiveness basis it's important. I think consistency so you didn't end up where you started -- which every country is different -- is important. And I think the American business community wholeheartedly supports TPP, including myself, and we're working hard to support it with the administration and on the Hill.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Jim, I'm going to reserve the last question for myself.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Sure.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: My mother, age 91, told me on the phone this last spring that she had just had a tour of the Dreamliner, and I'd always wanted to see the Dreamliner, and I asked, how did you get to go see the Dreamliner? She said, those nice executives at Boeing gave me a tour of the Dreamliner. So for those of us who've not been invited aboard the Dreamliner -- (laughter) -- could you tell us what the passenger experience is? How's it going to be different than what we're seeing? (Laughter.)
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: What's going through my mind is, you know, with all the delays we had -- I won't say it. Look, for a passenger, you can go -- it opens up 450 city pairs that were not connected directly before. Remember, smaller airplanes, 767-size airplane. And I'm making up the cities, but this is an example. You can go from St. Louis to Guangzhou, as opposed from St. Louis to Minneapolis to Hong Kong to Guangzhou. So not going through security lines on long international fights is a big one, and we got a lot of feedback.
<br><br>
Secondly, because the composite materials that we make this plane with are stronger than aluminum, you can carry a bigger pressure differential from the outside of the airplane to the inside, so you're effectively flying at lower altitude, which allows us to put more humidity into the cabin, which has a direct relationship to how you feel when you climb off the airplane.
<br><br>
And then there are a number of creature comforts. The entertainment system is wireless, which leads to more capability. The windows dim automatically and then there's all kinds of atmospherics we've got. And you're paying less for a ticket if the airline passes along the savings -- (laughter) -- because they're flying a plane that is 20 percent more fuel efficient and 30 percent more efficient on a total operating cost, which includes maintenance and capital. So it's a pretty big breakthrough.
<br><br>
So just get on one when you can. United is flying one this week for the first airline in America.
<br><br>
BRADLEY: Well, it's a privilege for the Council to have you here. Thank you very much.
<br><br>
MCNERNEY: Thank you, David. Enjoyed it very much. (Applause.)

Washington's actions have assaulted the capitalist principles that have sustained America's competitiveness since it became the world's largest economy nearly 140 years ago.

By<br><br>
Jim McNerney<br><br>
Updated May 11, 2011<br><br>  

Deep into the recent recession, Boeing decided to invest more than $1 billion in a new factory in South Carolina. Surging global demand for our innovative, new 787 Dreamliner exceeded what we could build on one production line and we needed to open another.<br><br>

<a href= "link02.html">劳资关系：Give peace a chance</a><br><br>


This was good news for Boeing and for the economy. The new jetliner assembly plant would be the first one built in the U.S. in 40 years. It would create new American jobs at a time when most employers are hunkered down. It would expand the domestic footprint of the nation's leading exporter and make it more competitive against emerging plane makers from China, Russia and elsewhere. And it would bring hope to a state burdened by double-digit unemployment―with the construction phase alone estimated to create more than 9,000 total jobs.
<br><br>
Eighteen months later, a North Charleston swamp has been transformed into a state-of-the-art, green-energy powered, 1.2 million square-foot airplane assembly plant. One thousand new workers are hired and being trained to start building planes in July.
<br><br>
It is an American industrial success story by every measure. With 9% unemployment nationwide, we need more of them―and soon.
<br><br>
Yet the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) believes it was a mistake and that our actions were unlawful. It claims we improperly transferred existing work, and that our decision reflected "animus" and constituted "retaliation" against union-represented employees in Washington state. Its remedy: Reverse course, Boeing, and build the assembly line where we tell you to build it.<br><br>

<br><br>
The NLRB is wrong and has far overreached its authority. Its action is a fundamental assault on the capitalist principles that have sustained America's competitiveness since it became the world's largest economy nearly 140 years ago. We've made a rational, legal business decision about the allocation of our capital and the placement of new work within the U.S. We're confident the federal courts will reject the claim, but only after a significant and unnecessary expense to taxpayers.
<br><br>
More worrisome, though, are the potential implications of such brazen regulatory activism on the U.S. manufacturing base and long-term job creation. The NLRB's overreach could accelerate the overseas flight of good, middle-class American jobs.
<br><br>
Contrary to the NLRB's claim, our decision to expand in South Carolina resulted from an objective analysis of the same factors we use in every site selection. We considered locations in several states but narrowed the choice to either North Charleston (where sections of the 787 are built already) or Everett, Wash., which won the initial 787 assembly line in 2003.
<br><br>
Our union contracts expressly permit us to locate new work at our discretion. However, we viewed Everett as an attractive option and engaged voluntarily in talks with union officials to see if we could make the business case work. Among the considerations we sought were a long-term "no-strike clause" that would ensure production stability for our customers, and a wage and benefit growth trajectory that would help in our cost battle against Airbus and other state-sponsored competitors.
<br><br>
Despite months of effort, no agreement was reached. Union leaders couldn't meet expectations on our key issues, and we couldn't accept their demands that we remain neutral in all union-organizing campaigns and essentially guarantee to build every future Boeing airplane in the Puget Sound area. In October 2009, we made the Charleston selection.
<br><br>
Important to our case is the basic fact that no existing work is being transferred to South Carolina, and not a single union member in Washington has been adversely affected by this decision. In fact, we've since added more than 2,000 union jobs there, and the hiring continues. The 787 production line in Everett has a planned capacity of seven airplanes per month. The line in Charleston will build three additional airplanes to reach our 10-per-month capacity plan. Production of the new U.S. Air Force aerial refueling tanker will sustain and grow union jobs in Everett, too.
<br><br>
Before and after the selection, we spoke openly to employees and investors about our competitive realities and the business considerations of the decision. The NLRB now is selectively quoting and mischaracterizing those comments in an attempt to bolster its case. This is a distressing signal from one arm of the government when others are pushing for greater openness and transparency in corporate decision making.
<br><br>
It is no secret that over the years Boeing and union leaders have struggled to find the right way to work together. I don't blame that all on the union, or all on the company. Both sides are working to improve that dynamic, which is also a top concern for customers. Virgin Atlantic founder Richard Branson put it this way following the 2008 machinists' strike that shut down assembly for eight weeks: "If union leaders and management can't get their act together to avoid strikes, we're not going to come back here again. We're already thinking, 'Would we ever risk putting another order with Boeing?' It's that serious."
<br><br>
Despite the ups-and-downs, we hold no animus toward union members, and we have never sought to threaten or punish them for exercising their rights, as the NLRB claims. To the contrary, union members are part of our company's fabric and key to our success. About 40% of our 155,000 U.S. employees are represented by unions―a ratio unchanged since 2003.
<br><br>
Nor are we making a mass exodus to right-to-work states that forbid compulsory union membership. We have a sizable presence in 34 states; half are unionized and half are right-to-work. We make decisions on work placement based on business principles―not out of emotion or spite. For example, last year we added new manufacturing facilities in Illinois and Montana. One work force is union-represented, the other is not. Both decisions made business sense.
<br><br>
The world the NLRB wants to create with its complaint would effectively prevent all companies from placing new plants in right-to-work states if they have existing plants in unionized states. But as an unintended consequence, forward-thinking CEOs also would be reluctant to place new plants in unionized states―lest they be forever restricted from placing future plants elsewhere across the country.
<br><br>
U.S. tax and regulatory policies already make it more attractive for many companies to build new manufacturing capacity overseas. That's something the administration has said it wants to change and is taking steps to address. It appears that message hasn't made it to the front offices of the NLRB.

The Two Men Behind the 787<br><br>
Boeing's Jim McNerney and Alan Mulally, Now at Ford, Pushed for the Dreamliner
<br><br>

By
Jon Ostrower And
Joann S. Lublin
Jan. 24, 2013 <br><br>

Two prominent U.S. chief executives have big bets riding on the outcome of Boeing's crisis with its 787 Dreamliner, the first jetliner model grounded by U.S. regulators since 1979.
<br><br>
The man with the most at stake is Jim McNerney, Boeing's chairman and CEO since July 2005, who presided over the Dreamliner's problem-plagued launch. Sharing paternity for the 787 is Alan Mulally. He oversaw the plane's conception and early development as head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division before departing to become head of Ford Motor in 2006.
<br><br>
Investigators in the U.S. and Japan are probing what caused lithium-ion batteries to burn on two Dreamliners owned by Japanese airlines, triggering the grounding. It's unclear when the 50 787s now in service globally will be able to fly again. A prolonged delay could disrupt plans to accelerate 787 production that are important to the financial future of Boeing, the world's biggest commercial plane maker and the No. 1 U.S. exporter.
<br><br>
Mr. McNerney has kept a low public profile since a Jan. 7 battery fire on a parked Japan Airlines Dreamliner triggered the current crisis. His only public comment has been three brief written statements expressing confidence the plane is safe and promising to work with regulators to find out and address what went wrong.
<br><br>
Commercial airplane chief Ray Conner was dispatched to represent Boeing at a Jan. 11 news conference with senior U.S. government officials, and Mr. McNerney has assigned Mr. Conner and other executives to handle much of the contact with airlines, according to a person familiar with the customer conversations.
<br><br>

Behind the scenes, Mr. McNerney has been actively involved in other ways, according to Tom Downey, Boeing's senior vice president of communications. The CEO has met with FAA chief Michael Huerta, and Mr. McNerney is running daily meetings on the status of the investigations and being updated regularly. He is also conferring with outside technical experts on the electrical issues to supplement the work of hundreds of Boeing experts assigned to the problem, Mr. Downey said.
<br><br>
Friends of Mr. McNerney say the low profile is consistent with his style throughout his career, which included a stint heading the aircraft engines unit of General Electric, where he was the runner-up to Jeff Immelt in the race to succeed Jack Welch as CEO. "He is cool. He is not emotional about things," Mr. Welch said in an interview.
<br><br>
But some governance specialists think the Boeing CEO should be more visible. The Dreamliner mess "is a huge hit to the company," says Richard Leblanc, who teaches law, corporate governance and ethics at York University's School of Administrative Studies in Toronto. "For a CEO under fire, firing off a press release is wholly inadequate."<br><br>

Through a spokesman, Mr. McNerney declined to comment. The company says Mr. Conner appeared at the Jan. 11 news conference at the FAA's request because as the head of jetliner production he is Boeing's main liaison to the regulator. 
<br><br>
Mr. McNerney, who moved to 3M as CEO after losing out to Mr. Immelt, joined Boeing's board in 2001. Two years later he joined the other directors in unanimously approving plans to proceed with the Dreamliner. The plane represented a big bet on new technology for Boeing: The plane's lightweight frame was to be built using mostly carbon-fiber composites, and it was to have an enhanced electrical system to power more systems and use less fuel than other jets.
<br><br>
At the time, Boeing had cut back investment in new products. Mr. Mulally, then head of Boeing's commercial airplanes operation, had to persuade CEO Harry Stonecipher and others to pursue a costly, all new aircraft. Mr. Mulally's previous project, the 777, introduced in 1995, was considered a success but had cost twice as much as originally planned. Mr. Stonecipher and his allies were reluctant to commit to a new jetliner unless the cost fell by billions of dollars.
<br><br>
Mr. Mulally was "under terrible financial constraints from Chicago" to cut the price tag of an all-new airplane, says Aaron Gellman, a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who has known Mr. Mulally for decades.<br><br>


During a 2003 board meeting, Mr. Mulally and Dreamliner program chief Mike Bair made a strong pitch to launch the 787 project, recalls a former Boeing director. "Mulally was an optimist" about how much money the new plane could make, but Mr. McNerney and fellow directors were skeptical, the ex-board member says. They nevertheless agreed to go ahead, figuring that "it's a wonderful plane. If we get half of that (projected) return, we would be delighted," according to the former director.<br><br>

In response to the pressure to reduce costs and risks, Boeing spread out the Dreamliner's construction and design over a larger network of global suppliers than in earlier phases, requiring them to share costs and use their own capital for factories and equipment.<br><br>


And in summer 2005, it hired Mr. McNerney as CEO, succeeding an interim chief after Mr. Stonecipher, who had resigned suddenly because of an affair with a subordinate. A short while later, Mr. Mulally, who had also been a contender for the CEO job, left.<br><br>

Boeing soon stumbled as a string of supply-chain and design delays pushed back delivery of the Dreamliner by 3.5 years. "We are trying to witch-hunt the issues in this program right now," Mr. McNerney told investors in October 2006 as the problems became apparent.<br><br>

The delays strained the company's credibility with customers and investors and hurt the bottom line. Boeing initially set a goal of keeping 787 costs to about $5 billion. Barclays Capital conservatively estimates the program ended up costing around $14 billion, not including the penalties Boeing has had to pay customers for late deliveries.
<br><br>
While Mr. McNerney had approved the Dreamliner's heavily outsourced business model as a director, his allies say that much of the 787's initial difficulty was beyond his control.
<br><br>
The former Boeing director and other industry officials say that Mr. Mulally was aggressive about fulfilling the timetable for the plane. "The outcome would have been dramatically different if he had stayed," the former board member adds. But the ex-director said that ultimately the commitment to deliver the 787 by 2008 was a mistake that "cost Boeing a lot of money."
<br><br>

Ford spokesman Jay Cooney said "it would not be appropriate" for Mr. Mulally to "comment on Boeing's business operations."
<br><br>
Last week, Mr. Mulally voiced confidence in the 787. "Clearly, I haven't been at Boeing for six years now, but I will assure you that the 787 is going to change the flying experience again, just like every other Boeing airplane," he said at the Detroit auto show. "New airplanes are very hard; the issues that they're having right now in the big scheme of things are relatively small."
<br><br>
In 2008, as problems and delays continued to mount for the Dreamliner, Mr. McNerney toured several of Boeing's key suppliers. At one plant, which made part of the fuselage, he asked managers what was keeping their production line from moving. They told him they were waiting on a part that Boeing itself made. Mr. McNerney expressed surprise, according to someone present at the meeting.
<br><br>
Mr. McNerney has conceded that Boeing went too far in spreading out the 787's supply chain. "We got a little bit seduced that it would all come together seamlessly and the same design rules would be applied everywhere in the world and corners wouldn't be cut and financial realities wouldn't hit certain folks," Mr. McNerney told an audience at an event in September.
<br><br>
To hasten completion of the complicated new aircraft, the CEO aggressively replaced key managers. Mr. Conner is the third head of the commercial airplanes division since Mr. Mulally left. Mr. McNerney also acquired several subcontractors in North Charleston, S.C., setting the company on a major expansion outside of its traditional Seattle commercial base.
<br><br>
It's still unclear whether Boeing's supply-chain decisions over the years played a role in the firm's Dreamliner difficulties. Aviation officials in the U.S. and Japan are trying to determine if the two major incidents this month were caused by malfunctions in the lithium-ion batteries or if some other part of the electrical system was at fault.
<br><br>
Boeing's investors have held relatively steady in recent weeks, with the share price down just 3% since the crisis began. Still, the stock has been lackluster during Mr. McNerney's tenure, rising about 14% in the 7.5 years since he took over, less than half the increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which Boeing is a component.
<br><br>
In late spring 2011, Mr. McNerney told fellow directors that they "ought to be ready" to replace him when he turns 65 in August 2014, the former Boeing director says. Some Boeing watchers thought he might stay beyond that mandatory retirement age. But the CEO role is a "brutal job" requiring considerable stamina, and Mr. McNerney may find it "scary if the (787) fleet is down for several months," the ex-director says.

Full Text: Boeing CEO McNerney Letter to Employees on 787<br><br>
Published January 18, 2013<br><br>
FOXBusiness<br><br>
Boeing CEO Jim McNerney issued the following note to employees Friday as the aerospace giant struggled with mounting worries over its 787 Dreamliner.<br><br>
The 787 and our commitment to safety<br><br>
I'm confident in the 787 because I'm confident in Boeing people.
<br><br>
This week the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and international regulatory agencies temporarily suspended 787 commercial flights in response to two widely reported in-service incidents with the airplane's batteries that have called into question the safety of the 787 fleet.<br><br>

As everyone inside the company knows, nothing is more important to us than the safety of the passengers, pilots and crew members who fly aboard Boeing commercial and military aircraft.  We also understand the importance of maintaining the confidence of customers and the flying public in the safety of the overall global air transportation system and the Boeing products that operate within it.<br><br>

We have high confidence in the safety of the 787 and stand squarely behind its integrity as the newest addition to our product family.  We are working around the clock to support the FAA, our customers, and others in the investigations, and we've committed to make available all Boeing resources to help find answers as quickly as possible.  In short, in the days ahead, we will take the steps necessary to assure our customers and their passengers of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service.<br><br>

Despite the negative news attention over the past several days, I remain tremendously proud of employees across the company for the decade of effort that has gone into designing, developing, building, and delivering the most innovative commercial airplane ever imagined.  Since entering service 15 months ago, the 787 fleet has completed 18,000 flights and 50,000 flight hours with eight airlines, carrying more than 1,000,000 passengers safely to destinations around the world. While the 787's dispatch reliability rate is on par with the best-in-class introduction of the 777, we will not be satisfied until the 787 meets the even higher standard of performance we set for it and promised to our customers.
<br><br>
My confidence in the future of the 787 is underpinned by my trust and confidence in you, the men and women of Boeing who have worked so hard, for so long, to deliver this game-changing new airplane to the world's airlines. Time and again, you have risen to both the challenges inherent to fundamental innovation, and the day-to-day problem-solving that is part of every new product introduction.<br><br>

As we learn more about the specific events in question and the plan to return to flight, we will be sure to pass them along to you.  Until then, keep up the great work on behalf of our customers and Boeing.
<br><br>
Jim<br><br>
